* 54:39 SiiKJoecool: @DylanBurnsTV I was curious If it was justified for the US to defend Kuwait from Iraq could the same be said for East Timor and Indonesia (I know the opposite happened and we supported them invading/genociding the Timorese). I think the key difference between these examples was the relationship between the aggressor/victim and the United states and I worry it shows we will support our allies if they are committing genocide.

* 59:25 SiiKJoecool: @DylanBurnsTV I was curious If it was justified for the US to defend Kuwait from Iraq could the same be said for East Timor and Indonesia (I know the opposite happened and we supported them invading/genociding the Timorese). I think the key difference between these examples was the relationship between the aggressor/victim and the United states and I worry it shows we will support our allies if they are committing genocide.

* 59:55 fmlwotisrigged: @bodhinirodha Im saying that I dont know and anyone here attempting to figure out what is motivating China is simply engaging in guessing. Besides, the US has been arming Taiwan since the late 70s, hence, contemporary defense agreements do not represent some new thing, hence sensing that the Chinese perceive this as a "direct" action doesnt make sense to me. But Im not a ChiComm who relies on some distorted view of reality.

* 01:32:30 Fluff1432: @TheDogHouseShow this is literally 2016 showing the documents and racial intent were both problematic
* 01:32:35 SadVato: What website is this?
* 01:32:35 bumhabu: @TheDogHouseShow pretty sure discriminatory intent is what's being discussed
* 01:32:35 AaronBreed: @trinitykhux cyber ninjas found that there were more votes for Biden than originally counted
* 01:32:45 Fluff1432: @TheDogHouseShow like am i hearing dylan wrong??
* 01:32:49 whataboutblm: @SadVato twitch.tv
* 01:32:50 97cats: Shrugging indignantly is Cruzs only argument
* 01:32:53 ImminentWon: @whataboutblm agreed, good call. schadenfreude at its finest
* 01:32:54 Mranonymouz: EZ
* 01:33:03 AstroLykos: EZ
* 01:33:22 Fluff1432: so now a 2nd one lol
* 01:33:24 TheDogHouseShow: @fluff1432 the way I am understanding is not whether it has a racist INTENT rather that it has a discriminatory impact but maybe i’m hearing it wrong.
* 01:33:27 talon_of_the_silverhawk: like how many forms of id sr their
* 01:33:30 Stubbleboy: This is the dumb shit Republicans want to argue about while our planet goes down in flames
* 01:33:34 TheDogHouseShow: I think these two are different
* 01:33:36 justcoolintbh: terrible
* 01:33:41 talon_of_the_silverhawk: @fluff1432 ^
* 01:33:51 Fluff1432: @TheDogHouseShow one is a cause of another . this just sounds llike optics lording tbh
* 01:33:56 whataboutblm: @Stubbleboy yup
* 01:34:03 theMorePerfectUnion: @DylanBurnsTV
* 01:34:10 Orbatos: If a private citizen did any of this they would be rejected by the court outright after the first couple times
* 01:34:12 DJQuad: what Fluff1432 said
* 01:34:20 letswriteascreenplay: @themoreperfectunion @thedogh asuhhhhh
* 01:34:27 letswriteascreenplay: Federal tax reform?
* 01:34:41 spacedawninc: that's what happens when you allow Stepford wife policymaking to create and ideology for you and creating one for yourself
* 01:34:42 TheDogHouseShow: @fluff1432 court cases all come down to semantics and in this case in deciding whether something is racist in intent versus a discriminatory impact are different and maybe they have the same conclusion but they do have a difference
* 01:34:42 jade144: nobody does it like Texas
* 01:34:58 whataboutblm: Please tell me CTV or RedNeq aren't on the panel tonight - there's only so much disingenuous folksiness i can take
* 01:35:03 Fluff1432: @TheDogHouseShow it was literally shown the entire intent was to distriminate
* 01:35:16 letswriteascreenplay: @whataboutblm they are genuine!
* 01:35:25 nvemb3r: Didn't a GOP operative pass away, and his daughter publicized documents detailing how to racially disenfranchise voters?
* 01:35:27 theMorePerfectUnion: seriously @DylanBurnsTV what is wrong with a person proving who they are when they vote?
* 01:35:35 theMorePerfectUnion: good..
* 01:35:36 TrinityKHUX: @whataboutblm CTV is
* 01:35:44 justcoolintbh: yikes
* 01:35:45 whataboutblm: @letswriteascreenplay i know, but it's easier for my brain to process their stupidity if i pretend they're being disingenuous
* 01:35:53 TheDogHouseShow: @fluff1432 discriminatory impact is not intent these are different
* 01:35:56 Orbatos: wtf was that statement
* 01:35:57 letswriteascreenplay: @whataboutblm

* 01:36:02 TheDogHouseShow: Maybe same conclusion but they are not the same
* 01:36:04 zlubars: @theMorePerfectUnion there's nothing wrong with it. why is it always paired with removing ways to get proof of identification?
* 01:36:14 Orbatos: the effect? it is racist
* 01:36:14 jade144: LOL set aside intent
* 01:36:18 XmasV0id: that only hurts his argument more LULWW
* 01:36:18 justcoolintbh: didn't texas also passed a law that let schools not teach about MLK jr lmao
* 01:36:20 afahy: if it's about the effect then it's definitely racist
* 01:36:25 theMorePerfectUnion: @DylanBurnsTV check your whispers..
* 01:36:32 Fluff1432: dude the fucking law was struck down because it was shown it was discriminatory.
* 01:36:32 poopman69lol: lol if they intend to be racist but fail its not racist?
* 01:36:49 excelerati: Motivated by intent is the tricky bit. We only need to show it's systematically racist, which doesn't require a racist actor involved. Saenz isn't arguing well.
* 01:36:51 crystalurker: hey ted cruz go f yourself
* 01:36:52 Orbatos: that was intentional on his part, he drove them to intent rather than effect which is the normal effect
* 01:36:52 Stubbleboy: @Fluff1432 No way around it
* 01:37:05 Orbatos: no? really?
* 01:37:09 theMorePerfectUnion: @theMorePerfectUnion ok.. so.. what can we do that requires voter ID and addresses your concerns.. is there no consensus approach that works?
* 01:37:12 Orbatos: uh
* 01:37:14 Orbatos: have they?
* 01:37:19 FixTheVote: I don't think that free provision thing is functionally true
* 01:37:20 Orbatos: in texas?
* 01:37:27 guptab123: Not this law tho
* 01:37:31 eskiymo: did i miss hippy dippy
* 01:37:31 Darke_Imp: I've never heard of being able to get a free ID anywhere in America
* 01:37:34 excelerati: Give out the IDs
* 01:37:35 97cats: What is wrong with his face, is he wearing a skin suit?
* 01:37:39 Fluff1432: @TheDogHouseShow so as dylan pointed out your point about it not being dscirminatory was worng
* 01:37:46 Aircraftspanky: Look at this fuckin worm
* 01:37:50 dancingwithdoge: What kind of last name is That?
* 01:37:53 theMorePerfectUnion: yet they said georgia's new law is jim eagle?
* 01:38:09 FemboySenpaiUwU: how do they get the free ID though because thats important. Is it mailed or do they have to go somewhere to get it? @DylanBurnsTV
* 01:38:10 Ecsol: I just googled this Hans guy. He works for the Heritage Foundation.
* 01:38:16 guptab123: So any law which has disparate outcomes, should be shot down ?
* 01:38:17 ericclaptonthesecheeks: Man the creature from pans labyrinth has really fallen on some tough times
* 01:38:17 theMorePerfectUnion: VOTER ID ISN"T THE Purview of the federal governmetn
* 01:38:20 whataboutblm: @theMorePerfectUnion literally every left leaning person you ask will likely be okay with voter ID as long as ID's are provided for free (actually free, not like "you need to submit 8 documents first that you might need to pay for in order to get your free ID" free) . this whole "no reasonable democrat wants voter ID!" canard you guys keep trying is nonsense
* 01:38:23 caseyjfromli: @dylanburnstv it’s never just VOTER ID tho in these bills it’s VOTER ID and WE ARE CUTTING HALF OF THE POLLING SITES IN THE BLACK PARTS OF CITIES @dylanburnstv
* 01:38:25 zlubars: He was also in Trump's justice department
* 01:38:27 brittbritt90d: @Ecsol wait really?
* 01:38:29 TheDogHouseShow: @fluff1432 It’s important to note i’m taking this at face value without specifically looking at the case itself which is pretty important
* 01:38:36 dancingwithdoge: @ecsol Oh wow makes sense
* 01:38:40 letswriteascreenplay: Federal tax reform!!
* 01:38:44 talon_of_the_silverhawk: @femboysenpaiuwu you have to go to get ids
* 01:38:47 justcoolintbh: need voter ID after losing all those voter fraud cases lmao
* 01:38:48 Ecsol: @brittbritt90d yup https://www.heritage.org/staff/hans-von-spakovsky
* 01:38:56 poopman69lol: wtf happened to ted, lizard people confirmed
* 01:38:58 Fluff1432: @TheDogHouseShow but the case is right there in front of you. laws made by the state of texis itself which kinda applyies "generally"
* 01:39:07 letswriteascreenplay: Tax the rich fine BUT STOP TAXIN EVERYoNE else!!
* 01:39:08 theMorePerfectUnion: @whataboutblm how do you propose to prove who you are for the id without some other document that withstands reasonable scrutiny?
* 01:39:09 kpfettstyle: they literally all said it can be
* 01:39:17 gentle_fish: Ooh Ted Cruz time to stop listening to Projekt Melody at the same time
* 01:39:20 FemboySenpaiUwU: @talon_of_the_silverhawk yeah thats what I thought so again its pointless if its free
* 01:39:26 whataboutblm: @theMorePerfectUnion oh you can, just don't charge people for it that's all
* 01:39:28 FixTheVote: this dumb fuck graduated from Harvard fucking Law
* 01:39:31 Rewardian: brave
* 01:39:31 Shadimar: on behalf of Canada, youre welcome for Cruz
* 01:39:32 zlubars: Saying that Voter ID laws *can't* be racist in intent or effect is such an absurd lie. It clearly has the ability to.

* 01:41:02 FixTheVote: polling data suffers from the fact that American voters are dumb as hell
* 01:41:02 theMorePerfectUnion: @brittbritt90d I will tell you why... once you codify that there hasn't been a thing (which is a lie.. there has always been voter fraud).. enough to worry about it, then you codify the very thing you say doesn't exist.. check your history..
* 01:41:04 brittbritt90d: @letswriteascreenplay sorry you hate facts and logic
