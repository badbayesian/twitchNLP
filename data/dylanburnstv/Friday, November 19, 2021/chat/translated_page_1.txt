* 47:08 debatebore: the cowards calling in death threats
* 47:11 Lethalbeee: That's generally really sad that whoever you are in the public eye today, you're likely to face death threats and harassment
* 47:12 kpfettstyle: hard disagree
* 47:12 Fluff1432: I have alot of thoughts on the sort of precedent this sets and the future of baiting people imo. I think kyle and his group did a lot to try and get these situations to happen for example. @DylanBurnsTV
* 47:13 thedevildances: he has been taking therapy for ptsd for the last year travis
* 47:22 ella_mariexo: Idk why it all had to be public especially considering he was only 17 at the time
* 47:23 travis222: @v1shh I don’t have milk in my cereal maybe that makes me worse
* 47:37 travis222: @thedevildances ah good
* 47:37 hannahmander: popping back to say if you think death threats are okay then you are a soulless being

* 49:01 krola_vers: @DylanBurnsTV you cannot expect that to a 16 year old
* 49:02 travis222: Rosenbaum probably wouldn’t have attacked him if he wasn’t alone and vulnerable
* 49:02 prebreakfast_banana: pretended to me a medic to insert himself further into the protest
* 49:04 kpfettstyle: yeah if he would have stuck with his group, I doubt this happens
* 49:04 Tower16: The question I have not seen asked is Where is the boy's father? No one seems interested, they just want to go after his fat mom
* 49:09 Lethalbeee: @DylanBurnsTV wasn't he with one other guy when the first shooting happened? then he split off alone after the first kill
* 49:14 Fluff1432: @DylanBurnsTV I think any reasonable human being would expect kyle to get into a confrentation with he and his group was doing
* 49:14 debatebore: But @DylanBurnsTV .. what the really merans is that the protest was clearly violent and says more about the "protest" than it does Rittenhouse...thats a post-hoc point youre making
* 49:15 thedevildances: yeah thats true but not really something you can hold him accountable for imo
* 49:18 Scyncer: Professional Douch only has his cameraman
* 49:21 kpfettstyle: also you can 100% expect that out of a 17 year old
* 49:25 TlS197: @DylanBurnsTV or why the kenosha guard thought it was okay to have a 17 year old go instead of someone older and more experienced
* 49:32 debatebore: @kpfettstyle neither provable or disprovable
* 49:40 danthestudyman: why is the ownus on him, instead of the idiots who attacked him?
* 49:40 kpfettstyle: @debatebore ok
* 49:40 MaraKorvus: Didn't you go to protest alone too?
* 49:45 Fluff1432: @DylanBurnsTV I think any reasonable human being would expect kyle to get into a confrentation with what he and his group was doing
* 49:48 Lethalbeee: He wasn't alone when the first killing happened tho
* 49:51 ella_mariexo: I can't believe you're only 20. You seem so mature for your age
* 49:52 eli_goose: if you're responsible enough to trust yourself with a gun, you should be responsible enough to take basic precautionary measures
* 50:01 SchrodingersMeme: Anyone know why Biden said he is angry about the result? Does he not know the details but decided to comment on it?
* 50:01 zezou124: yea its irresponsible but some people take to the extreme of justifying what happened to him
* 50:02 Nightbot: Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/DylanBurns1776
* 50:08 krola_vers: @DylanBurnsTV You should never go the huge protest. Too dangerous period
* 50:08 Typ34: you cant expect that out of every single person at a protest though
* 50:09 kpfettstyle: If you are at a protest you have to be safe. If you go to a protest with a firearm, you have to be more responsible than you normally would be
* 50:09 prebreakfast_banana: Does this mean we'll see more proud boy medics with rifles at BLM protests?
* 50:14 slingers2111: but did you have a gun to defend yourself?

* 50:44 seraphiem1242: Any riots or violent protest after the verdict will affect the appeal of progressive ideas to America's moderates

* 50:47 riverkilledthedoctor: @Lethalbeee my point was that righties with guns was not criticized by the right or the lawyer, but they roasted grosskreutz for bringing a gun, making it seem like only right leaning people can carry guns to protests.
* 50:51 tanelf5: Don't bring a skateboard or child molester to a gun fight

what's wrong with people?!

* 51:53 debatebore: @v1shh no, this verdict doesnt set a precedent for people going to a protest while packing a gun....my god, only a fool would think this....its hyperbolic at best
* 51:55 thedevildances: true
* 51:57 SepSyn: definitely
* 51:57 krola_vers: @DylanBurnsTV I didn't say the First Amendment is shit. But, there's a difference between huge protest and smaller one.
* 52:06 slingers2111: what did biden comment last year exactly?
* 52:06 badtakedumbasss: Sometimes the children like to sit on my lap and touch my golden leg hair. -Joe Biden
* 52:09 mdtaUK: Is there any way to appeal the verdict?
* 52:13 Fluff1432: @Itsghhost him and his group kept leaving the property and pointing guns at people. and getting into arguments and confrontations with people of thier choice while brandishing weapons

* 53:20 badtakedumbasss: He didn’t write that shit
* 53:21 v1shh: @debatebore you missed the part where i said “baiting for a situation to shoot them” or something along those lines. dw i get that you want to leave that out
* 53:25 debatebore: @mdtaUK yes, but it will be procedural grounds, i.e., the exclusion of evidence or some other argument about the conduct of the trial.
* 53:29 tanelf5: Second amendment!
* 53:32 travis222: Wait so he’s not happy with the verdict?
* 53:33 capitanclassic: “In September of last year, then Democratic presidential nominee Biden criticized incumbent President Trump on Twitter for refusing to condemn anti-BLM actors as “white supremacists.” The tweet text was accompanied by a video which showed an image of Rittenhouse’s face.”

* 54:12 Fluff1432: @Tower16 ok young one

* 54:54 thedevildances: does he wrong them though?
* 54:57 Fluff1432: @Itsghhost i dont think he was there to murder. But i think he was beggng for a confration or to intimidate people.

* 01:31:53 Fluff1432: @DylanBurnsTV THAT GUY DROPPED SO MANY HARD R
* 01:31:54 Cacophon: I hate to suggest that this is how the civil war starts, but...Right wingers now feel empowered to shoot at anyone threatening in protests and they're holding up this boy as their hero.
* 01:31:54 tyler176m: watched that at work today, its insane
* 01:31:55 travis222: He’s been villainised by most of the left and embraced as a hero by the right what do you expect?

* 01:32:18 Itsghhost: theres still a chance he just comes out to speak once give update then done hopefully
* 01:32:19 ThatGeekElle: Lefties need to get used to the idea that the Right is going to turn this kid into an absolute media personality/hero/role model. The people you've had on your show have already made these arguments and they're going to be not only insufferable, but dangerous.
* 01:32:21 v1shh: what u think?
* 01:32:22 crappyfisherman: Can you really blame Kyle though? CNN and MSNBC media has been shitting all over him for a year.
* 01:32:23 debatebore: @Cacophon absolutely batshit crazy nonsense....stop it.
* 01:32:24 vetalci: will talk about
* 01:32:29 exopolitiks: I just know there’s so much money out there that fascists and red necks want to give people like Kyle he’s going to be rolling in dough and laughing at all of us in about three weeks
* 01:32:29 DudeDr: DudeDr subscribed with Prime.

* 01:32:57 partia1pressur3: Dude he was partying with proud boys after the shooting. He's obviously super happy to be in the right wing spotlight
* 01:32:58 thedevildances: I still think hes not gonna stay public, might be wrong though
* 01:33:01 schmaltzii: Kyle will have more self-defense cases. This will last years
* 01:33:01 jd11991: because regardless of his lack of technical guilt, the guy is still a dumbfuck righty
* 01:33:01 infinityand0: IM JUS TRYNA BE FAMOUS
* 01:33:02 debatebore: @crappyfisherman and we all know that those pieces of shit will seek to badger him in relitigating the case on TV.

* 01:52:33 WastedDesign: widepeepoHappy DeepDishBard
* 01:52:34 ShostakoLich: "were a militia, these savages are destroying literally everything, who wouldnt want us around!"
* 01:52:35 ElektroRetro: how do we know they lied?
* 01:52:35 sayronari: @TheCoopShow the point of trolling is to get a rise, not just get called rtarded
* 01:52:37 Brentobox: It seems so dishonest when people ask why he was there, but just accept the people who were there to light fires and destroy things like that's legitimate.
* 01:52:37 v1shh: @loudnoises119 ofc!!
* 01:52:39 eddybombay: Bill Burr is my favourite living comedian. I'm so fkn glad he had a good take on this.
* 01:52:39 skullprism: @occupied_space There are people that watch the videos and the trial, and still have differing opinions, come on.
* 01:52:43 blacksinister: omg dylan didn't watch the tgrial
* 01:52:43 catchabutterfly: property over people argument.. sux
* 01:52:43 changeofhart: Everyone involved was white

* 01:52:50 whyamievendoingthis4real: saying they did opens them up to civil liability

* 01:52:55 brancoxiii: they lie
* 01:53:00 rathing0101: they would be liable for a lawsuit if they admit they asked
* 01:53:01 rizeus_v: they lie in court
* 01:53:03 slingers2111: its kinda weird victim blaming vibes
* 01:53:11 bohan_: do leftists still think they were black
* 01:53:14 kim_jong_rodman: so what happened? the defense said they lied
* 01:53:15 CATnum58: Why would you send a 17 yr old tho. That doesn’t make any sense
* 01:53:24 schmaltzii: the question is whether they are lying or not
* 01:53:27 drama10193: yea they would get sued to hell of they said yea
* 01:53:30 xmazout24: THESE ADS KEKW
* 01:53:33 zukk_mcdiq: right. He was protecting the property of sahil and amman. fat chance
* 01:53:34 Spudfm: when that doesn't fit your narrative "they lie" lol
* 01:53:34 rizeus_v: @CATnum58 they asked for people
* 01:53:38 CorporealEntity2502: look up khindri brothers lied
* 01:53:44 ElektroRetro: "people"
* 01:53:46 rizeus_v: they didnt know or asked for age
* 01:53:51 TheCoopShow: ohh wait checking the damage? i thought it was a "mostly peaceful protest"
* 01:53:56 ElektroRetro: you have the burden of proof if you say they lied
* 01:53:57 skullprism: @bohan_ No... I literally never thought the victims or perpetrators were black, but I've seen the video since last year.
* 01:54:00 brancoxiii: militia members corrobarated it
* 01:54:01 thedevildances: The layer claimed he was asked to be there but I think by someone else
* 01:54:02 rathing0101: witness testimony
* 01:54:02 TheCoopShow: who cares if they requested it or not. this is such a dumb far reaching point
* 01:54:02 hatchbackofnotredame: @bohan_ MSNBC even posted today that "Rittenhouse acquitted in shooting of 2 unarmed black men". They had to quickly edit that

* 01:54:04 ElektroRetro: bring facts or stfu
* 01:54:07 rizeus_v: The Militia said they did
* 01:54:09 TheCoopShow: dude was a pedo...doesn't matter in the case
* 01:54:09 eddybombay: @catnum58 because this is war. haven't you heard what Carlson, Pool, Jones and Owens said?
* 01:54:15 HeyuGL: @DylanBurnsTV one of the militia guys on the trial talked about how they gaave them the keys and let them goo to their roof
* 01:54:16 WastedDesign: why would asking them to defend it or not affect their insuranced? seems like bs to me

* 01:54:23 Legerdehmayn: so far this is all heresay
* 01:54:28 skullprism: @hatchbackofnotredame MSNBC isn't a leftist group. They are firmly neoliberal, my guy.
* 01:54:28 commdorvis: You weirdos who think 17-year-olds can't be heroes, haven't read Harry Potter?
* 01:54:28 ShostakoLich: wow! how did rittenhouse know??
* 01:54:38 mat_ca_ger: .... what ? isent He is in the image with him?
* 01:54:40 ram2045: the law is its legal to kill anyone i dont like
* 01:54:42 Occupied_Space: The point is that if those people didn’t chase and hit Kyle while he was holding a weapon, they wouldn’t of got ahot
* 01:54:43 Spudfm: who cares if they asked either way thats still a stupid position for a 17 year old kid to be in
* 01:54:45 kingc0ldhearted: It seems like it’s possible that they asked other people who were previous employees to be there, but that was only two guys. @dylanburnstv
* 01:54:47 Typ34: the guys rittenhouse were with said they were asked
* 01:54:49 brancoxiii: kyles friend, kyle, fat militia and slim militia said so
* 01:54:55 ElektroRetro: rittenhouse has Robocop vision, obviousl
* 01:54:57 ElektroRetro: y
* 01:54:57 TheCoopShow: i'm agreeing. thats my point to what you're saying. it doesn't matter if he was invited there or not. makes NO DIFFERENCE in the case
* 01:55:04 thedevildances: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GELJsS6Zxas&ab_channel=PBSNewsHour 12;08 @DylanBurnsTV
* 01:55:05 seanmac4566: i know from testimony that kyle freind said they he was asked on the stand @dylanburnstv
* 01:55:06 Occupied_Space: Yes exactly he lunged for his gun
* 01:55:08 inordinator: I understand why people are asking why he was there but the charges he faced were about his actions not why he was there so what difference does it make
* 01:55:13 my3lin_: if rittenhouse shot guy for being a pedo thats murder,, or bounty hunting maybe because the warrant, not sure on the laws there
* 01:55:14 hatchbackofnotredame: @skullprism That depends on who is interpreting "leftist". Anyone left of center is a "leftist" to a conervative.
* 01:55:20 CorporealEntity2502: How did Rittenhouse have Sam’s cell phone number in order to text him?
* 01:55:26 CATnum58: @eddybombay that’s rude. Those are clearly the biggest brains of our time.
* 01:55:27 Stoudman: yeah it's like...if you want to say nothing of value was lost, that's your prerogative, but was killing someone he didn't even know was a pedophile justified at the time? I don't believe it was
* 01:55:27 ram2045: if a store owner says it, its ok to commite murder
* 01:55:27 v1shh: @hatchbackofnotredame trur
* 01:55:30 Fluff1432: chat i edited the racists rant at kenosha can some of you watch it and confirm i censored it all ? https://twitter.com/Awwstin1432/status/1461854999609290759
* 01:55:34 skullprism: @hatchbackofnotredame Yeah, but conservatives are incorrect about that, so.
* 01:55:35 ElektroRetro: @inordinator there's more to any criminal act than simply the laws and charges, ffs
* 01:55:36 commdorvis: a minority-owned business too lol
* 01:55:39 rizeus_v: you watched the brother in the court, they were being sussy as hell
* 01:55:42 thedevildances: @DylanBurnsTV https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GELJsS6Zxas&ab_channel=PBSNewsHour At 12;08
* 01:55:42 CATnum58: @eddybombay that’s true*
* 01:55:47 rathing0101: I don't have a link, but Mark Richards put forth that they were probably lying to protect themselves from a lawsuit during their closing argument
* 01:55:47 ElektroRetro: yay, ban time
* 01:55:50 Legerdehmayn: comprehension skills, get em
* 01:55:51 LoudNoises119: #notall
* 01:55:52 slingers2111: I dont get why people get hung up on the fact that he was there, he was and that wasnt illegal. And alot of other people were there too. His intent clearly wasnt to shoot people, because all the shootings were legal
* 01:55:55 hatchbackofnotredame: @skullprism Sure, but I'd rather answer the person on their level rather than tapdance around semantics first
* 01:55:57 kingc0ldhearted: @dylanburnstv the wounds don’t line up with a lunge. The defense claimed that he lunged with his upper body horizontal, which is not what the footage shows.
* 01:55:58 TheCoopShow: lol i love this so so much. Don't agree with the decision and just start reaching for reasons that don't matter in the case

* 01:56:17 Occupied_Space: @slingers2111 I 100% agree with you
* 01:56:19 inordinator: @ElektroRetro yes and that was part of the case but his original intention for being there was not under question

* 01:57:08 kingc0ldhearted: Them asking him to be there would be pivotal in the case legally. It gives him the agency to defend the property and would prevent nullifying a legal claim to self defense.

* 01:58:57 seanmac4566: @dylanburnstv it sounds like there might have been a miscommunication between the parties. it also seems like Domonic Black was angling for immunity form the straw purchase charge. @dylanburnstv

* 01:59:43 hatchbackofnotredame: @partia1pressur3 And people keep bringing up the fact that he's 17 blahblah blah. DOesn't matter. They're trying him as an adult; in other words, as if he's as mature as the people he went with

* 01:59:48 tyler176m: monkaS this escalated
* 01:59:48 DJQuad: YAP
* 01:59:48 Seattle_ONE: because it was a chain of reaction that would have never happened without Rittenhouse being there in the first place. It is easy!
* 01:59:50 WastedDesign: its not 'my spot'
* 01:59:54 SepSyn: dumb hill to die on

* 01:59:57 Typ34: in the moments that he shot the people he was defending himself not the property so if he was invited to defend the property shouldn't really be relevent

* 02:00:16 DeepDishBard: "I would DIE for my gas station," said nobody
* 02:00:16 CorporealEntity2502: what's the morality of burning cars to protest a police shooting?
* 02:00:17 skullprism: @thecoopshow It kind of shows intent, bro.
* 02:00:20 brancoxiii: coop sounds like an awesome guy
* 02:00:21 Spudfm: this guy's all jacked up on mountain dew
* 02:00:22 vandernars: Sir Coop the Based
* 02:00:23 v1shh: i enjoy Coop’s voice
* 02:00:23 MoOdyMorgaN: if you argue he shouldnt be there then the other 200 people shouldnt be there either, and he was asked to be there
* 02:00:29 papa_boops: nothing to do with it? people died because of it
* 02:00:29 NeLLusD: Coop is mad

* 02:00:40 Wooda27: Hippy Dippy!
* 02:00:45 DeepDishBard: This call is difficult. Does anybody know a moderator
* 02:00:49 ElektroRetro: bad faith
* 02:00:51 The_Notorious_R_O_B: today was the beginning of the HOG revolution in this country. Then comes 2022 and then 2024.Jesus dude.
* 02:00:52 draven1895: Joker bb!
* 02:00:53 beastacle: no, it's context. whether it was justified self defense is hinged on whether what he was doing to begin with was legal or justified.
* 02:00:53 downsouthghost: DING DING DING LETS GET IT!
* 02:00:55 BeWyrd: I agree with skullprism
* 02:00:57 TheAlthingPolitics: It's illegal to be on private property without permission in any case
* 02:00:58 BodhiBoiBebop: I thought Dylan said he understood the legal decision
* 02:01:00 hatchbackofnotredame: No one ever argues that "none of th erioters should have been there". That's how you know people saying "Rittenhouse shouldn't have been there" IS disingenuous rhetoric
* 02:01:02 izzyrat: hippy dippy pregame
* 02:01:04 Aph3xSkorpioN: I honestly don't care if Kyle was there to admire the grass. It changes nothing
* 02:01:06 WastedDesign: even the car shop owners werent there, clearly their property wasnt of huge concern
* 02:01:09 rchristopherc: need a debate mod? LuL
* 02:01:12 Seattle_ONE: but his intentions are on tape
* 02:01:13 CorporealEntity2502: if police are unable to enforce laws, it's perfectly moral to grab a weapon to deter crime.
* 02:01:15 skullprism: Does it not show why he was there or intent for being there if he was asked? Coop, are you fucking serious?
* 02:01:17 hoodieCD: ?????
* 02:01:20 afunnylittleman: ugh
* 02:01:23 Drake_2112: Is it moral to ask a minor to defend your property? Maybe in extreme circumstances.
* 02:01:28 infinityand0: NOT self defense
* 02:01:29 dosemeter: Don't rain on his hiliday
* 02:01:29 FaceDeluxe: how dareyou talk about it from any other perspective
* 02:01:29 rchristopherc: I think his reason for being there is pretty important for the case
* 02:01:31 densespence716: this guy is ridiculous
* 02:01:33 WoweeFlan: MOUTH GO BRRRRRR
* 02:01:34 kim_jong_rodman: @WastedDesign they did go there. they even took pictures with kyle and his group
* 02:01:34 MoOdyMorgaN: self defense doesnt have anything to do with wether he should or shouldnt be there !
* 02:01:36 KingBoheme: @CorporealEntity2502 Ah, vigilantism! An American Tradition!
* 02:01:41 hoodieCD: he has not heard your coverage id put 100$ on it

@DylanBurnsTV

* 02:01:44 ArrPG: wow just full bad faith start to finish
* 02:01:44 vandernars: @TheCoopShow you right, dont let dylan tell you otherwise.
* 02:01:46 RverseUncleRuckus: is this guy best friends with destiny? stop doing opiods stfu
* 02:01:48 icyblock97: Bad faith
* 02:01:50 ElektroRetro: @densespence716 yeah, he's an objectively evil bad actor
* 02:01:51 partia1pressur3: It's being brought up because Rittenhouse used the fact that the business owner allegedly asked for his help as part of his defense
* 02:01:53 BeefyRainbow129: When's the roundtable?
* 02:01:54 effervesce0: This case and people's opinions of it have massive implications for society, well beyond the actual verdict. This shit is important to talk about
* 02:01:59 The_Notorious_R_O_B: dude these idiots kill me...... Id love for this "coop" kid to bring up these idiotic points to someone like hasan who would destroy him
* 02:02:02 WastedDesign: @kim_jong_rodman they went there to assess the damage from the night before but i dont think they were there either night
* 02:02:09 SynysterCola: lol dylan's answering and he's not listening
* 02:02:10 RverseUncleRuckus: why are you talking so fast you fucking idiot
* 02:02:11 schmaltzii: I think it's brought up so that you can continue to hate him. Your hate for him is fundamental and irrational. You're grabbing at straws.
* 02:02:14 ElektroRetro: smug laughter
* 02:02:15 SepSyn: extremely bad faith, and lying about Dylans takes as well. Kinda scummy
* 02:02:16 vandernars: @The_Notorious_R_O_B hasan is fucking brain dead
* 02:02:17 hatchbackofnotredame: @rchristopherc It MIGHT be meaningful. If he went there with a premeditated reason to commit murder, then there might be a case. But there's no evidence of that that the Prosecution presented
* 02:02:17 Seattle_ONE: because someone did a wild west move that led to dead people, for crying out loud
* 02:02:23 ThatGeekElle: Coop being dumb. Shocked Pikachu
* 02:02:25 whyamievendoingthis4real: coop is right
* 02:02:26 MoOdyMorgaN: he was asked to be there, you can tell the brothers were lying, they did not want to be sues because of this
* 02:02:28 rizeus_v: @CorporealEntity2502 If the proper channel has failed, dont see what is wrong with it
* 02:02:29 skullprism: @drake_2112 Whoever directly asked Kyle should probably be in trouble, tbh. If he was asked directly, or found out through a fucking FB Group? Those people should be investigated as to how Kyle ended up, as a minor, in this situation, and why it was allowed to happen.
* 02:02:30 HermitNinja: wtf - it's his fucking show - who the fuck is this guy to say what he should or shouldn't talk about on his own friggin show?
* 02:02:31 The_Notorious_R_O_B: @vandernars LOL YEAH DUDE !!!! Ok.....
* 02:02:33 nMustafayev: MS 13 is in my neighborhood to protect our business , they didn’t ask to me if I want protection but they just want to protect
* 02:02:41 chattsveryown: Dominic and Kyle testified they were given keys to the place and described the layout of the place and how they were told where ladders were and how they got on the roof. They even took pictures with them
* 02:02:41 hoodieCD: @The_Notorious_R_O_B hasan has the worse take on this OMEGALUL
* 02:02:44 godemperor4: Dude sounds like a budget jangles

* 02:02:46 rathing0101: kyle wasn't the vigilante, the vigilantes were the people trying to 'get him', and 'cranium that dude
* 02:02:46 dankprole: @schmaltzii nothing irrational about hating rittenhouse. he's a white supremacist
* 02:02:47 gulapogos: If there's hundreds of people trying to burn down my house, and the police aren't trying to stop them, I'd be pretty happy if some armed dude showed up to defend it whether I asked him or not
* 02:02:49 riverkilledthedoctor: shut up
* 02:02:52 partia1pressur3: I totally disagree with being able to defend property with lethal force
