* 03:16:27 MeteorJuice: @wan6saber she’s Canadian. And an animated avatar that does not know our ways
* 03:16:30 Mylv: @papa_boops ??? even one of the people shot had a gun and he testified on court that he was aiming at Kyle when he got shot in the hand
* 03:16:31 lateproletariat: Everyone must try to kill Kyle rest of his life, its legal now
* 03:16:35 PayeTrin: Kyle "bruh I'm just tryna be famous" Rittenhouse
* 03:16:35 slingers2111: haha james
* 03:16:38 Seattle_ONE: @Seattle_ONE It's ok. Although I'll never understand how one can be proud of ones place of birth - something which we don't have any influence of. Anyway, your high school German is good.
* 03:16:39 brainstew0: this guy's voice sounds like IRI

* 03:16:41 hoodieCD: so what is the point of bringing it up
* 03:16:44 Wan6Saber: @MeteorJuice *South African.....
* 03:16:44 lateproletariat: Legal Kill on Kyle
* 03:16:45 masonchutch: bad faith-pilled
* 03:16:47 soulin10sion: why do you leftists simp for arsonists?
* 03:16:47 DanLipmanM: If Kyle was an active shooter why wouldn't he just have turned around and shot everyone who was running at him right away ?
* 03:16:50 4Not_paroL: what should be more important is that you shouldnt attack people
* 03:16:51 papa_boops: @Mylv but what did the first person he shot have? a bag
* 03:16:54 HaoKanOvO: @angryliberal If you think the only option available to them was emptying the clip then you're a an actual moron. In other countries they're able to handle situations similar to this without doing that so the Black community is asking for that..
* 03:16:56 mugzy: One of the biggest problems is that too many only get their "news" from social media
* 03:16:58 thedevildances: Eris is probably talking about whos the hottest on the panel rn
* 03:16:58 4Not_paroL: not bringing guns and defending yourself
* 03:17:02 sicknehss: @DanLipmanM exactly. he had it all night

* 03:17:05 lateproletariat: He was in a school zone
* 03:17:07 Fluff1432: @thedevildances its me
* 03:17:08 hatchbackofnotredame: @Seattle_ONE CORRECT. No reason anyone should be proud of something they didn't do themselves
* 03:17:10 discomothra: Bringing a gun to a protest infringes on the 1A at protests
* 03:17:12 hoodieCD: lateproletariat is that a promotion of violence?
* 03:17:14 whatyouexpect: guns escalate situations
* 03:17:14 MeteorJuice: This guy has the same ringtone as the judge 100%
* 03:17:17 SevenAkuma: are you tho
* 03:17:18 bisoudoux: @thedevildances tru
* 03:17:20 4Not_paroL: LOL
* 03:17:20 PayeTrin: @DanLipmanM How would that make sense?
* 03:17:22 revid_ffum: Sounds like a pretty cool society
* 03:17:23 monkeyofdaharctic: i am so sick of this convo
* 03:17:25 Fluff1432: @DylanBurnsTV bro this is actually a really diverse panel good job btw
* 03:17:25 jj_416: @hatchbackofnotredame so its just a technicality then. i'd argue killing people is worse than bringing anything across some arbitrary border lol
* 03:17:27 blacksinister: watch bottom left agree to everyone and go on twitter to talk shit later. This guy has scummy vibes
* 03:17:28 soulin10sion: @whatyouexpect and arsonists dont escalate situations?
* 03:17:29 honk_honk25: hold the media accountable for firing up far left extremists
* 03:17:32 Selassie_Eye: Denimns noooo
* 03:17:34 hatchbackofnotredame: @jj_416 Basically, yea
* 03:17:35 Selassie_Eye: don't walk it back
* 03:17:36 detken26: That's the problem jackass.
* 03:17:37 ogsnowbonee: Idc what anyone sais the way Kyle managed to clear a jam and shoot the guys arm with the gun was hella impressive
* 03:17:38 totemi123: so go around and look intimidating to start shit then you can kill. okay

* 03:17:38 DylanBurnsTV: @Fluff1432 Thanks!
* 03:17:39 whatyouexpect: @soulin10sion never said that
* 03:17:39 4Not_paroL: ahh so the previous rant was just dumb lol
* 03:17:42 weebcosmic: Bruh, if you walk up to someone point at your gun but say "I'm here to help," you're still escalating
* 03:17:43 SplikittyLit: don't mind me just strolling through another state with a loaded firearm, definitely not looking to shoot anybody with my loaded firearm after inserting myself into conflict. yup, just trying to provide medical aid with my loaded firearm.
* 03:17:44 hoodieCD: @lateproletariat you are a weird sick people if you want someone killed. get help
* 03:17:45 Mylv: @papa_boops moved from that point pretty quickly, but that person was chasing after him after acting aggressive all night and having told that "i will kill you" to Kyle according to witnessess under oath
* 03:17:45 gringoguapo: @lateproletariat hey easy there
* 03:17:45 MaleRights_USA: The gun does not make the situation worst it brings safety
* 03:17:45 druidandrew: @thedevildances Eris IS the hottest person on this pannel
* 03:17:46 gluarrrrr: if ants show up blm nees to stomp on them and tell them to f off
* 03:17:46 RaleighBMusic: except for the multiple blk men who shot in self-defense and were then executed by cops!!
* 03:17:48 DanLipmanM: PayeTrin if you were an active shooter and people were chasing you, why wouldnt you just turn around and blast them? If you had an ar
* 03:17:53 Hallowedly: @thedevildances Who do you think is the hottest on this panel? Or, who do you think has the best background?
* 03:17:54 Fluff1432: Chat lets thank danabo and praise dylan for the super diverse panel!
* 03:17:55 puggsy16: You're allowed to walk around with a gun there, regardless of your political affiliation
* 03:17:56 bisoudoux: @weebcosmic ^^ yeee
* 03:17:57 cactuscain: so from now on all protesters should have guns

* 03:18:10 np_mark267: Bs
* 03:18:11 kim_jong_rodman: @Seattle_ONE danke. yeah you know i was reading this poll and it said most (or maybe a plurality) of germans wouldnt be willing to defend germany from an invasion. But in America pretty much everybody would at least say they would. Its very different
* 03:18:11 hoodieCD: @lateproletariat only if he attacks someone right?
* 03:18:12 ogsnowbonee: He went on tv after his testimony and lied his ass off
* 03:18:13 BjjBrain: Isn't self defence also assessing a situation to maybe avoid, self awareness is great initial self defence
* 03:18:14 jegkanikkese: Make claim, then fold instantly. How refreshing kekw
* 03:18:18 revid_ffum: The right engages in misinformation?

* 03:18:24 MaleRights_USA: Guns make a lot of situations safer . This was just a bad situation
* 03:18:28 4Not_paroL: the miss information was done knowing all the correct information was already out there
* 03:18:28 SynysterCola: who disagrees with that lol

* 03:18:44 bisoudoux: @SplikittyLit Just hanging out next to this riot i politically disagree with with my clearly visible loaded firearm, no biggie. Most americans wouldnt even see the problem with this KEKW
* 03:18:46 thedevildances: Hmm im giving it to kevin for the fashionable new beard
* 03:18:47 wowthatsruff: I used to watch this guy on Tik Tok when I was a conservative, hes pretty reasonable. I'd even argue he is more reasonable than Hunter during his gamer bro days
* 03:18:47 RaleighBMusic: maybe cops should stop killing blk men idk
* 03:18:48 np_mark267: The left has misinformation but the right denies racism ever existed
* 03:18:49 weebcosmic: A knife under the seat
* 03:18:49 Sch1ey: only 5/7 shots hit. not guilty
* 03:18:50 detken26: No because this happens repeatedly
* 03:18:50 brittbritt90d: false, Blake is irrelevant, is about George Floyd and systemic racism
* 03:18:50 Mylv: @papa_boops You can kill people with ur fists. Also if someone is grabbing your gun, they probably are not gonna use the bag on you
* 03:18:51 cervantes_13: the degree of misinfo that the left does is nothing compared to the right
* 03:18:55 Legerdehmayn: Both parties just need to admit the media disseminates false information for both sides
* 03:18:56 hoodieCD: @lateproletariat YOU ARE A FUCKING WEIRDO
* 03:18:56 audacenoire: @BjjBrain This is kind of my position. If Kyle had a reason to fear for his life, why would he place himself at the heart of the potential danger?
* 03:18:58 Tower16: @lateproletariat Cute

* 03:19:00 Littlefinger11: people keep gifting me subs
* 03:19:05 jd11991: Motivation and escalation are a thing. A reasonable jury could easily of found that he instigated the scenario, thats what they were debating, clearly.
* 03:19:05 HaoKanOvO: Sorry that shooting was unwarranted
* 03:19:05 ella_mariexo: Everyone just needs therapy
* 03:19:05 ogsnowbonee: Jacob Blake went on tv after and said he was attacking with a knife, media ignored it

* 03:19:16 MightyDuckShoes: so why is this being shifted to Jacob Blake? Did Kyle get his gun from Jacob Blake? Did Jacob Blake use his psychic waves to lead the mob?
* 03:19:18 beerisjuice: whataboutism
* 03:19:18 bisoudoux: @Heem HEEEEEM
* 03:19:18 Hallowedly: @SepSyn I think because of how technology is today, and how everything was filmed from multiple angles, it was just really hard to ignore the facts. So most of the dissent is only by the... extremes

* 03:19:27 slingers2111: @brittbritt90d of course the blake shooting was relevant for the riots and protest in kenosha
* 03:19:28 cactuscain: cop had plenty of time to tackle or tase Blake
* 03:19:30 gulapogos: @TheBasedGreeg Sorry. I think the cops were in the right to shoot an armed man attempting to kidnap the children of a woman he allegedly sexually assaulted (which was the reason for his warrant) after exhausting non-lethal options (tazed twice). And I think anyone who thinks differently is cognitively impaired

So Jacob Blake was holding a knife, and was walking through 2 taser attacks. He walks up to his car and opens the door with his children inside. What should be done? Should the cops just let Jacob Blake drive away kidnapping those children and stealing his GFs car?

* 03:27:16 angryliberal: @HaoKanOvO Nice Pivot! You didnt answer the question. Jacob Blake was getting in his car with the children inside. So he was going to steal the car and kidnap the children in there. So, do you think the Cops should have just let him drive away? Also, dumbfuck, Jacob Blake had a knife in his hand when he was shot. So if a cop tries to run behind him and pull him out the cop could have been stabbed. Once again you live in a fantasy land where you think cops are invincible and can just arrest anyo

So you really think that the cops are supposed to surround him, jump on his back while he has a knife, and potentially get stabbed? No. Your just a dumb fuck. And my point is 100% accurate, you think cops are supermen who are resistant to stabbings.

Like I said if other countries are able to handle these situations better without emptying a clip like a pussy because you're too lazy to do your actual job, yes I want it changed. The other cops who weren't next to him could have also flattened the SUV's tires while the two cops near JB could have physically restrained him.

* 03:55:28 jason_society: Killer Kyle had a history of violent behavior before this. He is going to commit acts of violence again and he is most likely going to kill again and these folks will find new ways to move the goal posts to cape for him. He will be lionized by the right and its going to create an environment rich with more vigilante type justice and it will disproportionately impact the poor and minorities.

* 03:57:52 tedlogan9000: trigger discipline....except when you shoot 3 ppl and kill 2
* 03:57:55 The_Fall_Guy_: Sadge put finger in gun
* 03:57:55 schmaltzii: Kyle isn't a hero, but he had good trigger disiplne and that should be commended

* 03:57:57 ella_mariexo: Guns aren't cool
* 03:57:58 PayeTrin: The weapon was checked by an officer - the prosecutor was trying to make an emotional stance about the feeling of having a gun pointed at you
* 03:58:00 EnbieVenezuelan: @EnbieVenezuelan That and the fact that black people are disproportionately affected by it are two ideas that coexist. It's not one or the other.

* 03:58:30 SplikittyLit: He's got such great trigger discipline. Too bad he doesn't have an equal amount common sense. Loaded firearm + seeking conflict within a riot = intense and likely deadly shit. Not rocket science.
* 03:58:30 adversary1: Thats why he waited till Rosembaum was touching his gun before he shot him

* 04:06:20 cradbabes: Like no, it is not inconsistent to say that some targets are legitimate & others are not, or that state violence committed against the people under capitalist bourgeois states is not legitimate or justifiable but people’s resistance to that IS. It isnt fucking nuanced or big brained to pretend everything is the same

* 04:07:54 MaleRights_USA: this has been a great panel
* 04:07:55 lichboner: i wish both sides didnt undermine our judicial system so much. It has problems but i think it handled itself well in this case

* 04:07:58 pcp10: Right wingers are more nuanced than left wingers
* 04:07:58 jd11991: right wingers aren't just stupid, they're evil
* 04:08:03 KingBoheme: @ApplesauceBJ So if I make money with my guitar, it's no longer my personal property?
* 04:08:05 EnbieVenezuelan: The case was built because 3 people got shot. It was a rational decision to determine through court whether it was legal or not
* 04:08:06 omniann: Wisconsin is lame anyway
* 04:08:08 tempest_blue: i just want everyone to know Biggs is 0-2 for correct uses is the word dichotomy over the past 7 days
* 04:08:10 Fluff1432: @ogsnowbonee i do know everything about it. like you have 5 seconds to explain how it was possibly self defense or ban
* 04:08:11 ApplesauceBJ: @kingboheme no.. private property is like McDonalds or Walmart.. buildings that are used for labor

* 04:08:23 RverseUncleRuckus: right wingers are scum, theyre all the things they call us
* 04:08:24 rathing0101: the curfew wasn't legally imposed
* 04:08:26 Amne: @Coffinspired actually, you are using reactionary wrong tbh, its more so a consertive mindset, but yeah, your rhetoric was a bit on that end of the spectrum so i was a bit perturbed by it seeing it being spouted consistently!
* 04:08:30 SepSyn: @chaeiry /s if not obvious
* 04:08:31 EnbieVenezuelan: Nope
* 04:08:31 lagoomba: Oh yes, My mother said nights were scary.

* 04:08:37 Seattle_ONE: @kim_jong_rodman This is really a very interesting time of our history too. Just be careful whom you're tallking to. Still lots of right wingers around tallking bullshit.
* 04:08:38 EnbieVenezuelan: Not true, right wingers always lying
* 04:08:41 CorporealEntity2502: @DD_The_Shmey if the majority of people in a community are active in their government(even attending public meetings etc) then I could see them more as a single entity. That's not true for most of America
* 04:08:42 stevodamus: These are the types of people who let him off. A jury full of chud fools lol
* 04:08:42 kingc0ldhearted: @deeplythundercat and if you drink water you won’t be dehydrated. But neither of these points address the fact that him being morally justified does not make him legally justified.
* 04:08:46 SingleDadKitchen:

* 04:08:46 Fluff1432: @ogsnowbonee explain how that lynching was self defense or ban
* 04:08:49 np_mark267: Never seen a vigilante claim self defense
* 04:08:50 LookOutMoon: this is a joke....
* 04:08:52 honk_honk25: @rathing0101 it really really should have
* 04:08:52 Amne: end of that spectrum* @Coffinspired
* 04:08:52 CyberianNight: @ApplesauceBJ If you rent that guitar out, it could be argued either way reasonably.
* 04:08:53 realtimefan: Gloves
* 04:08:53 BeWyrd: @rathing0101 I hadn't considered that. Everyone agreed the police stood back so yeah, it's like a temporary anarchy
* 04:08:54 Htcoldfusion: He was naive

* 04:09:00 RverseUncleRuckus: there is literally no right wing ideal that fits with todays society
* 04:09:02 KingBoheme: @ApplesauceBJ I get that distinction, but it seems arbitrary. My recording studio, for example. Is it my personal or private property?
* 04:09:03 Iolhax: Just a stolen valor andy that wanted a looter body count.
* 04:09:06 druidandrew: I disagree. If everyone is violating drinking and driving laws and you are the one that kills someone then its legit to be like wait a sec you should not have been drunk
* 04:09:06 detken26: Kyle is a hero to this guy.
* 04:09:08 ADifficultTruth: that was an ez clap @fluff1432

* 04:09:13 corneliusBhole: who is this peaky blinder?
