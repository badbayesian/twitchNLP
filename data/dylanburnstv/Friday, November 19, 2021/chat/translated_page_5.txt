* 05:05:37 cradbabes: That isnt true, China is often completely overlooked despite them having arguably as influential a role in history as Europe, & considering how China‚Äôs rise putting it at the center of discourse, and the blatant ignorance is making that discourse profoundly stupid & dangerous
* 05:05:38 stanczyk_98: Teach Americans geography

* 05:14:51 gravygravyjosh: They call it critical pedagogy which is a form of Praxis which means indoctrinating kids into their "lens" aka their own racial worldview
