* 02:05:44 skullprism: @dylanburnstv Is it possible to take a nuanced stance on the Rittenhouse case and see it as like. Kyle is being manipulated by many of the adults around him, and at the same time seeing the broader systemic issues?

Even if you buy the argument that Ziminskis point his gun at Kyle when he first ran onto the lot, that clearly didn’t deter Kyle in his goal of running onto the lot to stop people from smashing car windows and committing arson.
* 02:09:42 KingBoheme: @CorporealEntity2502 When you reply this way, you reveal yourself.
* 02:09:47 ElektroRetro: @dankprole have you heard about "the case" tho? checkmake, lib tard! /joking

* 02:10:15 ElektroRetro: @MoOdyMorgaN so the police are at fault, too. not a defense of Kyle.

* 02:41:21 oxkit0katxo: He didn’t cross state lines with the gun though
* 02:41:24 Sudz___: " get off"
* 02:41:24 voltasb: @kingboheme I just dont agree that that will be the result personally
* 02:41:25 runawaytrain: wis and Ill need a wall stop border crossings

* 02:41:35 MeteorJuice: How is the candidate reacting to an Vtuber animation, are they weirded out yet
* 02:41:37 deepsmoo: He never crossed state lines with the gun, people keep saying he did but it's incorrect

* 02:42:01 The_Notorious_R_O_B: if kyle was a black dude, HE WOULDNT EVEN BE HERE NOW
* 02:42:01 skullprism: @chunkey He might be remembering the old info? Either that or he meant Kyle himself did, and not the gun? Not sure, I hope he qualifies that later on.

* 02:55:08 JmsPlDnl: it's pretty clear he had right to defend himself. I think the question is more around whether lethal force was justified. You typically can't use lethal force against someone unarmed, which is why they focused on rosenbaum trying to grab the gun.
* 02:55:08 HeyuGL: @4Not_paroL you can
* 02:55:08 Tower16: @honk_honk25 A Smith and Wesson M&P
* 02:55:08 cradbabes: The legality of his actions, of any action, does not determine it’s moral legitimacy. Rittenhouse might be legally cleared, but that doesnt mean what he did was right or good or moral, & doesnt suddenly make criticising him/his actions illegitimate
* 02:55:11 laughterline: SOY
* 02:55:12 thedevildances: the judge didnt rewrite the law SOY

* 03:00:59 brittbritt90d: hunter is the left talking about himself
* 03:00:59 4Not_paroL: all you had to do was watch the fucking videos

* 03:01:05 4Not_paroL: instead of making shit up
* 03:01:06 gluarrrrr: that was the original narrative by the left for over a year
* 03:01:09 hatchbackofnotredame: The more the Left talks about Rittenhouse, the worst the Left will lose in the Midterms. It's that simple
* 03:01:11 monkeyofdaharctic: we flubbed it we lost this case lol
* 03:01:16 gringoguapo: yup
* 03:01:16 4Not_paroL: yup
* 03:01:18 Fluff1432: @SuperpowerBroadcasting i wana play civ 5 wiht you one day and see what you do with nukes
* 03:01:18 DeepDishBard: We need a Blunder Better Bill
* 03:01:18 XxMTGxX: @PayeTrin if snitching is the only way to prove that hes innocent to that then he made the right choice
* 03:01:19 hoodieCD: yep
* 03:01:20 discomothra: He’s wrong
* 03:01:20 crazed_lemur: lol people think hunter is left
* 03:01:20 This_Juan: yeah
* 03:01:21 The_Notorious_R_O_B: @PuckFlicker Wow thats right up there with the idiots who say lets go brandon....lol nice
* 03:01:22 braxnzgohome: Yup
* 03:01:26 hardwoodensock: @fluff1432 o shit. all go smoothly?
* 03:01:28 Hallowedly: It also was the case for Floyd and Arbery's case.
* 03:01:28 4Not_paroL: correct
* 03:01:30 Tower16: I long standing rule that is not unusual in courtrooms all over the country
* 03:01:30 discomothra: The judge stated that he hadn’t done it before
* 03:01:31 DrunkViking666: Great take
* 03:01:31 ogsnowbonee: It’s the left trying to use mob rule over due process
* 03:01:32 ImminentWon: the judge absolutely was a boomer, but he was indeed consistent
* 03:01:32 Mylv: @masonchutch Rosenbaum was sentenced to prison for sexually abusing five children — all boys between the ages of 9 and 11 — in Arizona’s Pima County in early 2002, according to his case file obtained via a public records request by Snopes. - is what they are talking about
* 03:01:33 bisoudoux: @crazed_lemur ??? what is he then
* 03:01:37 citizencicero: hunter on point
* 03:01:37 hoodieCD: @discomothra source?
* 03:01:39 SepSyn: @fluff1432 I predict he goes full ghandi
* 03:01:41 MaleRights_USA: @hatchbackofnotredame Well it just makes them look stupid and biased
* 03:01:41 partia1pressur3: Have they though, or are you just talking about some irrelevant people on twitter? Most pundits and regular people are generally of the opinion that Rittenhouse not guilty due to self defense
* 03:01:42 gluarrrrr: sue them all into the dirt
* 03:01:42 bisoudoux: @ogsnowbonee no
* 03:01:43 druidandrew: bring that point back in the religion debate. The church has so much ideological motivation to never conceed to any argument no matter how strong
* 03:01:44 slingers2111: hunter been learning from destiny on this point. good boy
* 03:01:46 GalilDoughty: Who the hell has called Kyle a hero? Seems odd.
* 03:01:50 ogsnowbonee: Judge was appointed by a dem
* 03:01:50 mugzy: The left should be emphasizing the arbery trial instead of this one.
* 03:01:51 thedevildances: hunter is a centrist chad
* 03:01:52 4Not_paroL: inc bad faith
* 03:01:52 KingBoheme: @hatchbackofnotredame I guess you haven't been checking those polls. A majority of people do not like the "not guilty" verdict. This won't hurt Democrats at all.
* 03:01:52 ConvictJ: that was a pretty solid take tbh
* 03:01:52 brittbritt90d: mob justice is objectively a good thing
* 03:01:56 Iolhax: It was a riot, sure. It doesnt mean Kyle (who said he would like to shoot looters not 20 days previously) could go and hunt them.
* 03:01:57 honk_honk25: @ogsnowbonee It sure seems like it
* 03:01:59 electricmeal: based
* 03:02:00 SwiftPigeon: @hatchbackofnotredame The left isn't the only ones talking about rittenhouse tho. Isn't Carlson having an exclusive interview? Pedestaling the kid is equally as sussy imo and to act like there isn't consequences to fanning these flames seems shortsighted
* 03:02:01 maciengineer: the left is a single entity or what? a lot of dumb people had bad uninformed takes about this, left and right
* 03:02:03 hatchbackofnotredame: @MaleRights_USA Unfortunately that kind of stuff can help sway elections
* 03:02:04 Fluff1432: @hardwoodensock dude the week afterwards was awwwwful. so much bandaging. Now its jsut a lack of using nasal spray. but for the first time in my life i can breath through both nostrils its awesome

* 03:05:17 RaleighBMusic: his guilt or inocents had nothing to do with ffs
* 03:05:17 kingc0ldhearted: No, he was biased because he explicitly only allowed negative character evidence for Rosenbaum and positive character evidence for Kyle. He also allowed the defense to bombard the jury with footage of Rosenbaum behaving aggressively towards people other than Kyle that Kyle was not a party witness to and therefore had no influence over Kyles actions.

* 03:05:31 kim_jong_rodman: @plush1993 it happened before the riots
* 03:05:33 Iolhax: Proud Boys tricked Kyle into throwing their gang sign and sing their Aladdin song right before J6 in the same way that he's going on Tucker tonight. Don't underestimate the right's messaging capacity and intent.

* 03:05:39 hoodieCD: brittbritt90d where did he say that?
* 03:05:40 ogsnowbonee: The left is a sad cult of emotionally unstable jealous clowns
* 03:05:41 TheBasedGreeg: I usually like Hunter, but holy shit that was ridiculous, Jacob Blake shouldn’t have been killed
* 03:05:41 plush1993: ah what am I thinking of? I got my dates mixed up
* 03:05:42 Fluff1432: Once again chat any questions asked during subs , or donations i will research it and share with chat.
* 03:05:43 kingc0ldhearted: Staying completely ignorant because leftists say dumb things is moronic
* 03:05:44 Vohrai: @brittbritt90d ?????????????????????
* 03:05:45 FishMissile: these protests are never about a single person. It's about the long history of systemic racism. jesus fuck.
* 03:05:46 Hallowedly: @brittbritt90d What? No he didn't
* 03:05:51 ziplockbaggies: imagine having a fact based conversation makes you "right wing" wtf lmao
* 03:05:56 hatchbackofnotredame: @plush1993 No. Jacob Blake was the reason for the Kenosha Protest. Pretty sad when you think about it
* 03:05:56 MaleRights_USA: The left misinformation is terrible the left has to confront this flaw
* 03:05:58 gluarrrrr: they were so desperate they lied as much as possible because orange man bad
* 03:05:58 thedevildances: my guy has a good voice
* 03:05:59 SweatpantsFreedom: it is misinformation to drive ratings....
* 03:05:59 Mylv: @loddidoddy if you are about to get stabbed, yes
* 03:05:59 LessThanBen: Hunter's centrism is showing
* 03:06:02 hoodieCD: @loddidoddy if you run at police with a knife you are asking for death

* 03:06:07 SevenAkuma: Centrism is based
* 03:06:11 honk_honk25: @bisoudoux I didnt say that, I am saying the whole BLM movement was white leftist and liberals using blacks
* 03:06:13 cactuscain: this whole debate is misinformation
* 03:06:14 Aether0: holding a knife = shoot him. holding an AR 15? let him walk towards you and talk to him about the two people he killed
* 03:06:14 audacenoire: Yeah...Kyle's definitely *not* a hero. He was some random kid who got it in his head that he was Rambo, grabbed a gun, and charged off to war. I think calling him a hero legitimizes that fantasy.
* 03:06:18 hardwoodensock: @sevenakuma truuuuu
* 03:06:18 exopolitiks: Well Kyle’s little bro on the right is going off
* 03:06:20 dosemeter: The right has plenty of misinformation.
* 03:06:23 ogsnowbonee: The left uses disinfo to exploit black plight for political power, they don’t give a fuck about blacks
* 03:06:26 angryliberal: @HaoKanOvO NO. Not gonna let you get away with that. It absolutely was misinformation. Lefties said that Jacob blake shooting was horribly unjust and was an example of police misconduct. That led to BLM protesting over it. EVen though in reality it was a completely just shooting.
* 03:06:28 mugzy: people like to say "if kyle was not there, these people would have not have died". Who is to say that Rosenbaum would not have attacked a different person with a gun.
* 03:06:28 KingBoheme: @hatchbackofnotredame Maybe vigilantism is not a big deal to you. Maybe the worst won't happen. But playing political football with it is a bad idea. The GOP will endorse vigilantism before this is over.
* 03:06:30 brittbritt90d: @hoodieCD he said systemic racism (why people were protesting) is "leftist misinformation" literal hunter quoite
* 03:06:30 plush1993: oh I was thinking of the girl who tried stabbing the other girl earlier this year. I think that's another example of leftist misinformation or overreaction
* 03:06:34 Chris114: so far this guy and tikitok guy seems to be the only one who watched it fully
* 03:06:35 Hallowedly: @TheBasedGreeg JACOB BLAKE DIDN'T DIE YOU SPOON
* 03:06:36 hatchbackofnotredame: @honk_honk25 prove it
* 03:06:39 GalilDoughty: Cut them checks
* 03:06:40 exopolitiks: Kenosha happened because of an officer involved shooting not leftist disinfo

* 03:06:48 aliprand: what a dumb argument
* 03:06:49 Seattle_ONE: the thing is - in Germany no 17 year old would drive 20 miles to become part of such an "event". That is no 17 year old would have a gun that would give him the comfort to know that he will be quite safe bc when it comes down to it, he would always be able to just kill people

* 03:07:29 ogsnowbonee: Where are the black leaders on the senseless murder of dolph, ripe
* 03:07:29 hatchbackofnotredame: @KingBoheme They won't. But you and other leftists will continue to fearmonger as if it's coming. And when it doesn't, it will be one more thing the Left is wrong about.

* 03:07:40 thedevildances: what this was the most entertaining trial in a long time??
* 03:07:40 Hallowedly: @brittbritt90d No, you're lying. He never said systemic racism, he said the Kenosha incident with Jacob Blake is what caused the Kenosha Riots.
