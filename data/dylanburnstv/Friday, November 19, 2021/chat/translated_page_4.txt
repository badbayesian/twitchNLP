* 04:23:29 nuts3514: @gulapogos its an opening statement
* 04:23:30 skullprism: @discountlegremoval Barely. Arguing that the Boston Tea Harbor was fine, but black people rioting when the legal system, very similarly to how the legal systems benefited Britain back in the 1700s, benefit white people so much, is bad? MLK himself literally said, "Riots are the language of the unheard."

* 04:23:37 schmaltzii: @fluff1432 Rioting wasn't really As effective as everyone says it is, during the civil rights movement specifically. Nad even though rioting can work like in the LGBT case I cant remember. But under major forms of change rioting and war take place. Like during the revolutionary war.

* 04:35:59 cradbabes: Also teaching the bad parts of US history doesnt mean thats the ONLY thing we teach, it absolutely isnt. In its current form kids are taught FAR more revisionist & whitewashed American history that frames themselves as the best & most amazing country ever

* 04:36:15 thepurpleproject: COINTELPRO is an incredibly important part of recent American history
* 04:36:17 honk_honk25: I am more of a STEM guy, you should know history, but I dont think we should focus on it too much

* 04:36:46 deepsmoo: CRT is a rejection of liberalism especially as pertains to race, the liberal idea is that while we might notice race, we shouldn't consider it on our personal lives or public ploicy. Thats what the civil rights movemt was based on. CRT theorists want the opposite they want to rasie racial consciousness., which only begets more racism, CRT bad.
* 04:36:47 Coffinspired: @thepurpleproject, Not taught in any public school I'm aware of.

* 04:37:31 Liquescence: if you want to be objective, it is a subjective statement, I'm ok with acknowledging that
* 04:37:31 DarkArrak: @honk_honk25 History is how we comprehend why STEM was made, who STEM benefits, and predict how STEM will end.

* 04:39:43 coolOLDs: Because... CRT IS a GRADUATE study! Even humoring this should disqualify you. lol
* 04:39:44 Rewardian: The argument follows that the pedagogy of the CRT infused are infiltrating the public school system. What then? Lock 'em up?
* 04:39:45 cradbabes: Also teaching the bad part of US history doesnt mean thats the ONLY part that should be taught, or that is taught. As it stands, kids learn far more whitewashed “America is the best & most awesomeist ever!” History than anything else. Whilst i dont think the revisionist & whitewashed American exceptionalist version of history should be taught, there are plenty of positive things in US history that could be taught
* 04:39:45 druidandrew: Its definitely one sided. I say teach debate rather then just some particular beliefs.
