grabbed it and flipped it over behind their car blocking them in their parking
space.

* 05:34:55 Feral_Thoughts: The John Deere strike. Ill find the video posted on the anti-work reddit and it caused quite a bit of controversary. The other reality is that the majority of factory and industrial workers tend to be more conservative and support republicans.
