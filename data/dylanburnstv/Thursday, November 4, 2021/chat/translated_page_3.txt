* 06:03:12 roller_dragon: POLY NEVER WORKS
* 06:03:13 erinfeesh: the problem is it's a blanket statement, and you could say non monogamous relations also could be borne out of insecurities
* 06:03:13 Alloyed: idk aren't insecurity and trust two sides of the same coin? any arguments to biology are a bit cringe to me but yeah
* 06:03:20 ENT0VA: @fluff1432 so if ur partner tells u would u be okay with it
* 06:03:31 kpfettstyle: If people are going into a Poly relationship because they fear people will leave, then they are for sure going to fail
* 06:03:36 SidMachinery: polygamy and polyarmorie are 2 different things
* 06:03:40 Fluff1432: i agree i think poly is more often rooted in fear of commitment
* 06:03:40 blujyuh: @iwrestleweebs well wait i dont necessarily agree with vaush but thats just a crime, non monogamy isnt lol
* 06:03:46 oopzilla: we set arbitrary lines up in other places. its not unheard of
* 06:03:48 MightyDuckShoes: @jj_416 I mean. It is a lot more formed than just general conspiracy theory. It's why Alex is so pissed at Q lifting his grift whole cloth. Even the Q thing is older than 2017. Q was an anon member who roleplayed as Q from Star Trek. Someone co-opted the username.
* 06:03:58 porrage: Monogamy didn't evolve in our ancestors because of "insecurity." Human ancestors evolved without penile bones specifically because they became more monogamous
* 06:04:20 roller_dragon: but... beauty and youth fades... who will YOU talk to when you aren't pretty anymore
* 06:04:26 Fluff1432: theres just not scientific basis for vaushs take tbh

* 06:05:19 DaryKohi: Just got here. We talking about non-monogamy?
* 06:05:47 erinfeesh: I think if you say "no my partner can't talk to other men" then yeah that's probably part insecurity, but that doesn't apply to all monogamous relations thats just silly
* 06:05:49 roller_dragon: monagamy: yes or no
* 06:05:50 ENT0VA: Being insecure and being honest arent mutually exclusive lol
* 06:05:57 psychopax360: Monogamy just feels like it breeds insecurity
* 06:05:59 Graves1986: I think monogamy is so socially encouraged that people often develop insecurities about relationships that never get challenged
* 06:06:04 archipelajoe: @darykohi pretty much
* 06:06:13 kpfettstyle: @roller_dragon why does it have to be yes or no? Can't some relationships work with it and some could work with poly?
* 06:06:17 DaryKohi: @archipelajoe Is there a disagreement?
* 06:06:27 catchabutterfly: we should have a poll monogamy or no
* 06:06:38 SageOfSixMatts: It‚Äôs like obviously you‚Äôre going to be closer to one partner if you spend most your romance and time with them. Opposed to someone who spends it with many people
* 06:06:45 kpfettstyle: Are people on the show anti-monogomy?
* 06:06:59 archipelajoe: Vaush is saying Monagomy is based in insecurities. that's the main disagreement

* 06:08:06 archipelajoe: Sex can totally fuck with a person's mental state especially if you aren't emotionally ready for it
* 06:08:21 Fluff1432: vuash is completely ignoring the concept of intimacy imo
* 06:08:23 SchrodingersMeme: I think sex workers would get attached if they had the same client for many encounters
* 06:08:41 kpfettstyle: @SchrodingersMeme many of them do have the same client for many encounters
* 06:08:43 Fluff1432: its not arbituary vaush. intimacy isnt a completly social concept lol
* 06:08:53 roller_dragon: shit, even if you ARE ready for it
* 06:09:20 archipelajoe: Plenty? that's a very empirical number
* 06:09:27 AstroLykos: Is it insecurity to want your partner to feel the same way you do naturally ?
* 06:09:28 kpfettstyle: Also if a child grew up with a poly family, it probalby wouldn't be weird for them until they are told it's supposed to be weird
* 06:09:34 danialdin: I know lots of people in poli relationships that have kids
* 06:09:41 SchrodingersMeme: @kpfettstyle and I would guess that they do establish some forms of emotional connections to them. id be curious if they could do a study where they look at brain scans, oxytocin is an insanely powerful chemical

* 06:10:23 Fluff1432: lol ok vaush you dont have magic insight nobody else has
* 06:10:26 moink1234: Vaush has literally said before that sex is not a unique social interaction. That's why he keeps comparing it to less meaninful things like ski ball and talking
* 06:10:29 kpfettstyle: Maybe @SchrodingersMeme but I for sure know sex workers who do not establish emotional connections at least in a romantic or psuedo romantic way

* 06:13:31 dankprole: @SepSyn italian men are well known for cheating no??
* 06:13:43 pillowpants2012: non-monogamist vaush now that he has worked out
* 06:13:45 Fluff1432: vaush is just to introspective and self aware for monogomy lel
* 06:13:50 kpfettstyle: are they @dankprole ?
* 06:13:51 SepSyn: @dankprole this is a harmful stereotype, don't do that here
* 06:13:55 corneliusBhole: depends on the movie
* 06:13:58 psychopax360: men in general are known for cheating @dankprole
* 06:14:04 kpfettstyle: I've never herad that stereotype lol
* 06:14:11 dankprole: @SepSyn shoe did you hear shoe accuse heem of eating sand?
* 06:14:11 roller_dragon: do not mess with italian women who are very italian... found that out badly
* 06:14:19 ENT0VA: @psychopax360 U mean women
* 06:14:27 SepSyn: @kpfettstyle there are certain races that get that stereotype, not exclusive to itialian folk
* 06:14:40 Graves1986: Experiences are always informed culturally 100% of the time?
* 06:14:42 catchabutterfly: oxytocin
* 06:14:52 SidMachinery: DylanBurnsTV did you see samantha using the r-word in eristocracy chat?
* 06:14:57 SepSyn: @dankprole yes I heard that, but we aren't on stream
* 06:14:58 kpfettstyle: @SepSyn ah well it's my understanding the Italians are one of the four acceptable people we can be racist against. Italians, Russians, English, Americans
* 06:15:00 roller_dragon: but is it a stereotype if its true?
* 06:15:03 psychopax360: I mean my knowledge is based on American men so ehh @ent0va
* 06:15:03 WastedDesign: disneyland?
* 06:15:05 n_o_s_e_x: vaush is a disney adult. makes perfect sense.
* 06:15:12 Alloyed: im imagining a sitcom that's vaush on tinder and it's all seinfeld anecdotes
* 06:15:15 Fluff1432: oh god dude this is so psuedo scientific

I'm just sensitive cuz I'm Italian

* 06:15:39 DaryKohi: What lmao
* 06:15:39 archipelajoe: Oof
* 06:15:39 SepSyn: @kpfettstyle don't forget the french!
* 06:15:40 MightyDuckShoes: That isn't the same thing. That's a gender class taboo for men and women to engage in any interactions since it would be assumed there can't be platonic interactions.
* 06:15:42 kpfettstyle: oh I see @SepSyn
* 06:15:42 WastedDesign: i had some great experiences taking experimental hallucinogens at a japanese theme park

* 06:15:58 themoops2: @kpfettstyle I remember Polish jokes being pretty mainstream like a decade ago.
* 06:16:01 kpfettstyle: @roller_dragon that's not evidence
* 06:16:08 archipelajoe: A lot of cultures thought the same.
* 06:16:11 roller_dragon: ...ha!
* 06:16:12 ENT0VA: @psychopax360 I feel like i‚Äôd get different answers depending on who i ask
* 06:16:15 SepSyn: @dankprole tf there are stats on this? wow
* 06:16:15 kpfettstyle: @themoops2 the polish are the most oppressed people

* 06:16:43 passiveaggressive44: I hated catholic school
* 06:16:43 casaubon_: not just Christianity
* 06:16:46 Armand_duc_de_Richelieu: "Catholics aren't Christians"

* 06:20:41 roller_dragon: hot take: ALL religions say THE SAME FRIGGING THINGS!!
* 06:20:48 catchabutterfly: @dankprole sweet üëç
* 06:20:54 Fluff1432: idk this just feels like vaush thinks he understands human emotions better than everyone, and has zeo scientific evidence for this take, but is acting like its fatual.
* 06:20:55 erinfeesh: I think he's applying "insecurity" in a way that he personally thinks is intuitive
* 06:20:55 dankprole: np! this is a great stream
* 06:21:22 themoops2: @roller_dragon I don't think I quite buy that
* 06:21:33 archipelajoe: it must suck to not be able to talk to your partner

* 06:24:15 ENT0VA: Yerp
* 06:24:17 Fluff1432: "ive talked to monogomous people" vaush this would be fine if you were posting this as a shower thought. but you cant be like "if you disagree with me its cause your not introspective enough"
* 06:24:28 SepSyn: you have to be okay with your partner being attracted to other people even if its not the coolest feeling in the world
* 06:24:33 n_o_s_e_x: no. i don't do that. that's bizarre jealousy shit.
* 06:24:37 dankprole: press conference over

* 06:24:51 corneliusBhole: very good stream
* 06:24:53 DaryKohi: Fuck, caught the tail end of that. Is the argument Vaush was saying is that because of intrusive thoughts, monogamy is not real, or what?
* 06:24:54 catchabutterfly: yes, ty üòä
* 06:24:54 ENT0VA: Yea tbh but i‚Äôd get over it i hope
