* 01:23:06 angryliberal: @DylanBurnsTV I understand yeah. Destiny just pulled up the email where there was a proposed debate topic. Destiny heard the first topic and agreed to it and then Actual Jake said after that that he wanted to change the topic to something slightly different from that. And I think Destiny just didnt see the second reply from Jake. Destiny is live right now watching your stream lol. Just call him on Discord.

* 01:25:46 georgedlurker: @dylanburnstv we still don't have evidence he actually gave up on it tho. It's probably a chatter baiting
* 01:25:47 centrespiral: destiny needs to pull out vaushes nudes and just jerk off until hes over it
* 01:25:47 Gigglegasm: Toxicity on twitch NEEDS to be talked about, and destiny needs to be talked to about it. This seems like a good debate topic in general. Doesn't sound like he is flaking
* 01:25:48 VillageFeeder: I don't think Jake has fleshed-out positions to debate. Isn't he just an anti-anti-SJW reaction channel?

* 01:26:49 angryliberal: @DylanBurnsTV It seems pretty clear that Jake will not debate on a topic with destiny unless he knows he has an advantage. Hence why he wont debate Destiny on any REAL topic they disagree on.

* 01:57:32 W1lh3lm: did the topic change for Destiny?
* 01:57:34 cammyart: @Fluff1432 That's my point. ONly jake agreed. Destiny was afk.
* 01:57:36 JanglesScienceLad: fukn love LonerBox
* 01:57:37 XeroDimension: Maybe Destiny should have read his messages. Then he would have had more than an hour instead of crying about it.
