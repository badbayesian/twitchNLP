* 06:21:41 Iolhax: @Twinstinx arson is neither a sufficient or necessary component in the legal designation of a riot nor who is or is not a rioter. You are not a lawyer and all the people shot or not shot by kyle are on trial for "rioting". Kyle was there to mow people down (as is evidenced to me by his statement about looters, and his shoulder-fired, magazine-fed, semi-automatic gun) and Kyle wasn't protecting property, so it seems to me their characterization either way is beside the point.

I watched that debate, DM was saying that RGR was trying to scientifically justify her transness, and the consequence of that is that line of thinking makes RGR a transmedicalist (which she is). Destiny then used that statement to make attacks questioning the validity of DM. I had the same questions as DM because RGR's statements in that debate would lead to me not being considered trans even though I'm a binary trans woman

Where as with Rileys argument you have an actual objective basis for justifying the validity of transness. Either way you sound like a really reasonable person, so I respect that btw!

That some may have been rioting (again not our designation to make, nor one that has been made for the dead or for the event in general) is not related to Kyle's motives or the trial.
