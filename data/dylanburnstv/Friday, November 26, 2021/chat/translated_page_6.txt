* 05:24:48 iTakerr: @twentyzeros That's not what he's fucking saying, you're obviously of the camp that destiny is never allowed to clap back at anyone clapping at him, basically, since his audicne is bigger, hes never allowed to clap back, get the fuck offline lol

Let's argue ethics

* 05:27:44 SageOfSixMatts: @mantis_repair_man Zherka was completely in the wrong. It was his channel he was using to broadcast slander of Destiny to the public. That vod has 100k+ views

* 05:27:51 mantis_repair_man: @sageofsixmatts How though? According to destiny, he doubted RGR's gender because he took part in the demon mama discourse. But Jon Zerkha also only did that, so what's the problem? The actions alone are of the same idea.
* 05:27:51 NormalRobot: now corn's just running out the clock

* 05:28:03 Rewardian: In your ethical opinion, what is ethics, or your ethics?
* 05:28:06 iTakerr: @t00fik Is he just not allowed to ever engage with anyone just because his platform is bigger? Are you implying that after a certain threshold you just can't engage with anyone ever because of the POTENTIAL backlash?

* 05:45:59 kittyjerkface: Aren't Destiny's NFTs just like merch? Does corn not know what merch is?
* 05:46:02 IkeaSecurity: @frostyboiz this is like saying there is no "product" if you buy a download of a song. That's just a file that is replicable and you can download. There is a product for social, support, and sovereignty reasons

* 05:49:36 EntropyStable: But destiny is clear these won't rise in value.
* 05:49:37 SpartanVFL: A lot of people buy NFTs and dont intend to sell it, just like artwork

* 05:49:42 teleportinturtle: SOME PEOPLE JUST WANT THEM. NOT EVERYONE IS INVESTING IN THEM.
* 05:49:42 Arno_QS: Jake would really do well to learn literally anything about NFTs before opening his mouth
* 05:49:42 meencuisine: @maddycakes_ they aren't inherently a scam, what makes them a scam is how they're sold. your previous comment about being a net negative also applies to most consumer products btw
* 05:49:43 DaryKohi: Does anyone in this chat like the corn guy? DM him. Tell him to stop talking about NFTs. This is sad.

* 05:50:10 Smartsport101: I don't even like Destiny but he's not scamming people by selling someone an NFT, people know exactly what they're paying for and there is no lie behind it.
* 05:50:11 versaceguap: has jake brought up a single good example yet?
* 05:50:12 LiberalWorldOrder: I use to watch the bible reloaded years ago, it ie rediculous how badly Jake has fallen

* 05:58:27 Morningst4R: Corn is actually a Destiny fanfic writer trying to research his next book
* 05:58:28 mcgnarley99: Destiny DUNKED on corn man through this whole debate
* 05:58:29 chizurufan23: @this_juan why the fuck are non hisapnic people calling him it, would they call a non Hispanic person gusano
* 05:58:30 IkeaSecurity: jake seemed like the type of person to only read rittenhouse headlines this entire debate

* 05:58:41 Iolhax: @Twinstinx The same dingus judge also said Kyle's statement's about shooting looters wasn't admissible and Kyle wasn't even charged for the curfew violation because thw public wasn't lawfully notified. Please, kindly, fuck off back to Destiny chat.
* 05:58:41 jmcj07: @This_Juan yeah dude, and the f-slur means just a bundle of sticks

* 05:59:18 whale_hole: @This_Juan sp*c isn't a slur, it's just a shortened term for hispanic. You're literally gross, and should be ashamed of yourself
