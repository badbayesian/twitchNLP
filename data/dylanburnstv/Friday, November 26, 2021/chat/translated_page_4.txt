Thats not a whataboutism, you bringing up another issue instead of addressing that one IS. You're logic is apparently that since some people in chat have have called destiny a nazi or fascist then it's ok for him to call other streamers terrorists directly.

* 04:14:29 real_moflo: he didn't mock the suicide attempt. he pointed out the irony of giving mental health advice when you just tried to off yourself

* 04:14:30 TheACEinhibitor: i wonder when the first cage match is gonna be used
* 04:14:31 DaryKohi: @detectivekeaton It's because he holds very contradictory positions. He loves being toxic. He says it's image and brand. Then when it's rhetorically beneficial he pretends he's never toxic. Clown shit. 🤡
* 04:14:32 CJOracle: even if they do, why weaponize that against them Destiny?

* 04:14:51 partia1pressur3: Destiny's harassment of Doe is a bit tangential, Destiny's argument is essentially that from his perspective his community isn't that toxic because he also receives plenty of toxicity, including death threats. Jake would need to deal with that

* 04:19:12 Vinder_Skygge: No twitter is not toxic.. twitter CAN be toxic
* 04:19:12 Roastafarian: the great random number generator in the sky
* 04:19:13 lagoomba: You can say whatever, or we can be cognizant. This is ridiculous.
* 04:19:13 cheltz: asking for help is attention seeking of course.
* 04:19:13 partia1pressur3: Jake's hyper focused on the Doe stuff. While fucked up, it doesn't go towards showing that DGG is any more toxic than anywhere else
* 04:19:14 versaceguap: LOL
* 04:19:15 HallanL: the hippy dippy logo at the bottom isnt centered...... monkaS

* 04:19:35 xitruzz: Blame the platform. Urk, liberals. It's always the systems fault. Personal accountability is a fantastical concept
* 04:19:36 Crestonof: But I'll keep making accounts every time I'm banned. Also, Twitter is toxic.
* 04:19:38 yasstv: @DylanBurnsTV when i JLP i wanna set my tivo

* 04:19:42 aWetBusSeat666: YES
* 04:19:43 scarho: why would you tweet at or about a popular creator and then claim victim if their fans go after you or the creator responds? Is that the fault of everyone else or yourself?
* 04:19:43 bud561: thank god jake chose this topic and declined the original
* 04:19:46 ReavesTwitch: Jake is almost to a point where he has to somehow defend twitter...and that's gonna be rough.

* 04:28:21 urbanedensity: Refrain from being toxic =/= being nice
* 04:28:21 ExarchPaul: The victim is 100% at fault for their own internet interactions, like people with mental health issues don't also have issues with avoiding toxic environments; traumatized people often re-engage with toxic relationships that they have experienced and been hurt by before, for the simple fact that it is familiar; the human brain seeks familiarity
