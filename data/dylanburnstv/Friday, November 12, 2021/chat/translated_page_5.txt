* 05:24:59 Inconspicuousbox: but then there's still a chance you convict an innocent person. there is no 100% certainty
* 05:25:00 hangmoredong: eyewitnessesnever lie and dna is never transferred innocently
* 05:25:01 tck42: Eyewitness evidence sucks. How can Connor be this ignorant? He worked in law enforcement?!!
* 05:25:08 Galtic_TV: As investigate tech gets better, so does the ability to fake it. It also demands a greater ability to discern what is good technical evidence, and bad technical evidence from the average citizen on a jury.
* 05:25:11 rathing0101: its not though, the boomers running a court room aren't competent enough to form complete and true understanding about every issue simply because the technology is better
* 05:25:13 xephryll: DNA when coupled with video evidence is far better... but, really... without acknowledging that the most extreme form of surveillance genuinely offers the most secure station in liberty is the real discussion. But we commoditize security to the people who can offer the best dollar, and have absolutely no recourse against people who control it.
