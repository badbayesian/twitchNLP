* 03:27:30 ClockworkIndigo1: who is brant arguing with, they all already agreed its self defense
* 03:27:31 brittbritt90d: because he has to do murder legally
* 03:27:31 TonyBalon3y: he went to defend property and ended up using his weapon to defend himself because of the situation he put himself in
* 03:27:32 dicehammertv: While defending property
* 03:27:33 prettyboygordo: because it was well premeditated
* 03:27:37 bens_tatertots: how come he killed exactly many people as he did
* 03:27:38 PayeTrin: Cause then you dont get off - if your going to do a massacre - thats not self defense
* 03:27:39 skullprism: @hatchbackofnotredame No... Literally no. They just don't want people killing others at these things.
* 03:27:40 WastedDesign: thanks for telling us the defence argument again brant you boorlicier
* 03:27:46 mahavishna: Also an AR 15 isnt all that deadly a weapon... There are FAR more Deadly Weapons he couldve acquired.

* 03:28:10 ADifficultTruth: chat can we keep it within normal, civil, and TOS?
* 03:28:12 ranthefool: It does matter if he claims any defence oof property. No one was harmed , a trailer got burned woo hoo. And that is neither protecting anyone, not has he any personal excuse to defend anything. And as far i know being a vigilante, a vigilante with an illegal weapon, is not defending property

* 03:28:21 rooseytwo: is Riley able to talk about this? just got here
* 03:28:22 maybee420: We have given police every tool possible. What is the point of funding all this military gear if we need vigilantes?
* 03:28:22 Teeny_Turtle: @mahavishna that is irrelevant
* 03:28:25 prettyboygordo: it's becoming the purge guys
* 03:28:27 riverkilledthedoctor: @SleepyRunt ???? you just assumed this didnt you? you realize college students are broke right?
* 03:28:27 SporkofDeath: Well yes, that's because you fundamentally refuse to acknowledge the political aspects of it because that would make your own political beliefs look worse.
* 03:28:29 xbonesstyle: it's against TOS to point out the proud boys are WS in a material sense?
* 03:28:29 partia1pressur3: You don't get to kill someone just because they're going to beat you up

* 03:28:43 wallanderxd: Active shooters don't generally run away from the angry mob led by a child rapist KEKW
* 03:28:44 LycanGTV: So should he just submit and risk death because of their misunderstanding, Vaush?
* 03:28:45 h0wlive: Shot in the back?
* 03:28:46 bobjuiceunderfrank: "shot in the back" GET VAUSH OFF THIS PANEL
* 03:28:48 bens_tatertots: yea and people are trained and normalized to active shooters
* 03:28:49 cdn123: Would a reasonable person go alone up to a person who had threatened them earlier in the night with a open carry??? no rittenhouse wanted a legal kill and he had his target, he then ran from the scene and did not turn him self in to police , he could of said he was involved in the shooting that just occured.
* 03:28:53 ranthefool: You mean he shot soeone and peopl went in alarm mode and though he was a shooter
