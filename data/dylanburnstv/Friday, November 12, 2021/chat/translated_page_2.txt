* 03:27:24 shkibby1: what was the game he was hunting again?
* 03:27:24 SleepyRunt: Vaush has never lived paycheck to paycheck, so dont try to make him sympathize with the idea that someone's life would be ruined if their place of work was burned down
* 03:27:25 riverkilledthedoctor: ??? its almost as if he went there hoping to ge ta legal kill

* 03:27:25 WastedDesign: blah blah
* 03:27:27 weebcosmic: What kind of question is this????
* 03:27:28 tck42: Durr how could he have heard about self defense durr
* 03:27:28 atterrant: talon_of_the_silverhawk oh gotcha yeah you can answer that yourself
* 03:27:28 basedamericafirst: his whyte supremacist mindset should have taken them all out
* 03:27:30 ClockworkIndigo1: who is brant arguing with, they all already agreed its self defense
* 03:27:31 brittbritt90d: because he has to do murder legally
* 03:27:31 TonyBalon3y: he went to defend property and ended up using his weapon to defend himself because of the situation he put himself in
* 03:27:32 dicehammertv: While defending property
* 03:27:33 prettyboygordo: because it was well premeditated
* 03:27:37 bens_tatertots: how come he killed exactly many people as he did
* 03:27:38 PayeTrin: Cause then you dont get off - if your going to do a massacre - thats not self defense
* 03:27:39 skullprism: @hatchbackofnotredame No... Literally no. They just don't want people killing others at these things.
* 03:27:40 WastedDesign: thanks for telling us the defence argument again brant you boorlicier
* 03:27:46 mahavishna: Also an AR 15 isnt all that deadly a weapon... There are FAR more Deadly Weapons he couldve acquired.
* 03:27:47 Galtic_TV: @drippyiffy I absolutely will
* 03:27:48 basedamericafirst: rooftop koreans
* 03:27:51 talon_of_the_silverhawk: @iolhax he had a fire eatingisher you know hoses have to connect to something right?
* 03:27:51 PayeTrin: Its called getting a legal kill
* 03:27:55 DNAV1VO: Medical aid with an AR-15 lmao
* 03:28:01 PayeTrin: super argument
* 03:28:01 wallanderxd: >Active shooter who's actively retreating OMEGALUL

* 03:28:07 xbonesstyle: what's going on with the mod?
* 03:28:08 mahavishna: @DNAV1VO yeah... soldiers do that too.
* 03:28:10 ADifficultTruth: chat can we keep it within normal, civil, and TOS?
* 03:28:12 ranthefool: It does matter if he claims any defence oof property. No one was harmed , a trailer got burned woo hoo. And that is neither protecting anyone, not has he any personal excuse to defend anything. And as far i know being a vigilante, a vigilante with an illegal weapon, is not defending property
* 03:28:13 NeonIc0n: irishladdie stoking up his base of twitter warriors? say it aint so?!!

* 03:28:21 rooseytwo: is Riley able to talk about this? just got here
* 03:28:22 maybee420: We have given police every tool possible. What is the point of funding all this military gear if we need vigilantes?
* 03:28:22 Teeny_Turtle: @mahavishna that is irrelevant
* 03:28:25 prettyboygordo: it's becoming the purge guys
* 03:28:27 riverkilledthedoctor: @SleepyRunt ???? you just assumed this didnt you? you realize college students are broke right?
* 03:28:27 SporkofDeath: Well yes, that's because you fundamentally refuse to acknowledge the political aspects of it because that would make your own political beliefs look worse.
* 03:28:29 xbonesstyle: it's against TOS to point out the proud boys are WS in a material sense?
* 03:28:29 partia1pressur3: You don't get to kill someone just because they're going to beat you up
* 03:28:30 Iolhax: @talon_of_the_silverhawk he crossed state lines with a fire extinguisher?
* 03:28:31 Occupied_Space: The real criminals are all those protestors

* 03:28:42 PayeTrin: @krazymonk27 totes
* 03:28:43 wallanderxd: Active shooters don't generally run away from the angry mob led by a child rapist KEKW
* 03:28:44 LycanGTV: So should he just submit and risk death because of their misunderstanding, Vaush?
* 03:28:45 h0wlive: Shot in the back?
* 03:28:46 bobjuiceunderfrank: "shot in the back" GET VAUSH OFF THIS PANEL
* 03:28:48 bens_tatertots: yea and people are trained and normalized to active shooters
* 03:28:49 cdn123: Would a reasonable person go alone up to a person who had threatened them earlier in the night with a open carry??? no rittenhouse wanted a legal kill and he had his target, he then ran from the scene and did not turn him self in to police , he could of said he was involved in the shooting that just occured.
* 03:28:53 ranthefool: You mean he shot soeone and peopl went in alarm mode and though he was a shooter
