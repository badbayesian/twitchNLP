* 26:51 lazer_kiwi: So that basically means Trump wins by electoral college
* 26:53 hannahmander: listen I don't need more anxiety in my life
* 27:00 lazer_kiwi: By probably a landslide
* 27:25 hannahmander: dems need a better candidate than biden
* 27:28 lazer_kiwi: Not Tim Pool-style 49 state but probably more than 2016
* 27:35 rolandstott: @DylanBurnsTV it should be a concern bc you're not looking at a pollster who got much closer to actual vote percentages. it means trumps actually ahead
* 27:36 Ard_Ryan_86: The corporate wing of the party has alienated the labor core of the party.
* 27:42 rolandstott: look into the poll, see its d+x%
* 28:39 rolandstott: the dem party went way more white , educated, and richer
* 28:41 Ard_Ryan_86: If you promise over and over and don‚Äôt deliver, people shop around.. there‚Äôs a lot of Hispanics that are becoming conservative as well.
* 29:13 hannahmander: this stuff is super interesting
* 29:30 kpfettstyle: so dems flat out lost 2 million votes
* 30:49 kpfettstyle: no let's skip this part
* 30:53 hannahmander: suburbs would swing red probs with a different republican than trum0

![](https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v2/25/default/light/1.0)

* 32:55 lazer_kiwi: I think the candidate matters here though. Trump is a protectionist, it's a no brainer for manufacturing towns to vote for him
* 33:15 anseis_lover: how bout a bake sale
* 33:21 anseis_lover: everyone loves cookies
* 33:38 melgreufe: I moved to a rural county from a big city. I‚Äôm going to turn it blue
* 34:26 SepSyn: @lazer_kiwi a salient point
* 34:27 commdorvis: Republicans could lean into the isolationism and protectionism, might be a good move for them seeing as McCain and Romney lost hard and Trump won
* 34:30 hiveMentality: you can always fall back on the mega corporations that are backing up your party
* 34:30 rolandstott: eh, there was a big exodus to florida/texas from nyc/cali, so thats a lot more blue in swing states
* 35:32 Mellakos: What time does the debate start peeps?
* 35:33 hiveMentality: that was before mail in ballots
* 35:34 SepSyn: Biden stated he would be a one term prez. Kamala could find a dem representative of these communities to run as VP and if the infrastructure bill helps these communities that could also help
* 35:55 lazer_kiwi: @commdorvis For sure. From this point forward Republicans are a protectionist, nationalist party, I don't think there's any going back to free trae neoconservatism tbh
* 36:17 hannahmander: ppl don't see Biden as working class tho, I feel
* 36:59 rolandstott: i literally can't find this poll, even from their twitter it only takes me right to their main page
* 37:11 SepSyn: its bizarre how the reps managed to switch to a party that working class folks identify with, even as their candidate is a billionaire from NYC
* 37:23 rolandstott: dylan, cities have grown and had a larger population, that 1% is a huge boost
* 37:24 lazer_kiwi: @hannahmander Also true, I think if Bernie was the candidate this wouldn't happen
* 37:33 hannahmander: @sepsyn i've always wondered the same thing
* 38:17 rolandstott: nvm playing poker, didnt read table
* 38:19 hiveMentality: how do you go from getting more votes than Obama, Hillary and Bush and have such low poll numbers? lol...
* 38:26 hannahmander: @lazer_kiwi probably,but he was too far left for some of the moderates or Republicans fed up with Trump. still would've liked Bernie...
* 38:31 SepSyn: so what can we do now?
* 38:40 SepSyn: ah I imagine we will get to that
* 38:44 hiveMentality: Better get those mail-in ballots and dead people to go vote hahaha

* 42:03 ImminentWon: lmao the fact that job loses and healthcare loses made people shift to the right is so ironic
* 42:04 LurkusIgnoramus: people vote against their own interests. the gop spews lies about how lowering taxes increases brings in good paying jobs and how democrats promote "job killing regulations" and the plebes eat them up.
* 42:42 lazer_kiwi: @ImminentWon Not at all when you have a candidate that blames it all on immigration and outsourcing
* 42:42 melashingo: @sepsyn if hell was real then Reagan is in the VIP section
* 42:49 SepSyn: we got fucked in Upstate, I grew up climbing gutted industrial buildings
* 43:04 hannahmander: manufacturing jobs are probs more likely to be held by ppl w high school education/no post secondary, matches up with the trend of republican demographics

* 43:19 ImminentWon: @lazer_kiwi oh, i agree that's WHY they voted that way, i just find it ironic they are voting AGAINST their own interests
* 43:22 LurkusIgnoramus: why do unions "blow ass"?
* 43:39 tisysteven4550: @LurkusIgnoramus have you been in one

* 43:43 brittbritt90d: @LurkusIgnoramus it's a personal anecdote, they don't
* 44:12 tisysteven4550: @brittbritt90d no i was in 2 different unions and they didnothing for me
* 44:18 LurkusIgnoramus: @tisysteven4550 my union status is irrelevant. i'm asking you why you believe unions blow ass.
* 44:19 melashingo: @sepsyn inshallah
* 44:20 evo_lutia: As a kid I knew a lot of my Dad's friends voted for Dems, in the hopes of defending their unions. Once the remnants of those unions were gone the drifted away from the party.
* 44:29 brittbritt90d: @tisysteven4550 that's literally by definition a personal anecdote and hence meaningless
* 44:29 Ard_Ryan_86: @sepsyn Not just that, but trying to keep it together in the wake of those reforms.. has lead some Unions to become not only ineffective.. but also more corrupt.. over complicating the workers lives as well as the employers. Thus, unions look bad, while the companies and corporations creating the desperation get off the hook.
* 44:29 ImminentWon: i convinced that when automation turns the US into a hyper capitalist hellscape a la mad max, the right will be cheering
* 44:37 tisysteven4550: @LurkusIgnoramus no it matters
* 44:50 lazer_kiwi: @lazer_kiwi I disagree it's against their own interests. It's absolutely in their interests to vote for a protectionist that will raise tariffs and bring back manufacturing (at the expense of the american consumer of course)

* 49:13 Ard_Ryan_86: People wonder why Bernie did so well until the Party kind of out their power behind Heir Apparent Hillary.. Bernie actually went to those places and spoke directly and frankly, but convinced them he would actually stick it to the corporate elite and help their communities. But, he didn‚Äôt win.
* 49:23 Frog_TV: @hannahmander you might be onto something. My mom usually voted republican and she voted for Biden because Trump was so bad

* 49:31 imustbeNemo: Traditional battleground states are trending red. The orange loser forced suburbs to vote blue, but it's not a foregone conclusion that it'll hold.
* 49:36 danabo: It's a good job Trump told the Repubs not to vote.
* 49:39 hannahmander: @frog_tv that's exactly what my mom did too
* 49:51 SuperpowerBroadcasting: There‚Äôs a perception that Dems are at war with the suburbs. They need to change that
* 49:57 archipelajoe: Bernie
* 50:02 SepSyn: Blue Dogs
* 50:04 Roastafarian: maybe they shouldn't have jerked the progressives chain so much in the last two elections
* 50:06 SuperpowerBroadcasting: Hillary Clinton also won the pop vote

* 50:21 imustbeNemo: Step 1: abolish electoral college
* 50:22 Alloyed: democrats as ansyn party lets gooo
* 50:26 SepSyn: howdy Kev
* 50:27 ImminentWon: unions returning to their former glory would fix a lot of things, actually
* 50:30 SuperpowerBroadcasting: The Dems should run Hillary Clinton in 2024. She was the most based candidate the Dems have had in 30 years
* 50:36 jenn_here: DeWine is our gov now, ugh
* 50:43 SepSyn: We need to build the labor movement back up or make a new one
* 50:52 SepSyn: Labor is always the way to win these communities
* 50:57 SuperpowerBroadcasting: @danabo how‚Äôs it going?
* 51:08 SuperpowerBroadcasting: @sepsyn What‚Äôs up?
* 51:11 imustbeNemo: Yeah I'm becoming more and more concerned that Biden won't be strong enough to re-win
* 51:17 danabo: @SuperpowerBroadcasting Eating some food. Getting ready for some debate.

* 51:18 ImminentWon: strikes are going on globally, actually. take india for instance
* 51:20 imustbeNemo: Even with incumbent advantage
* 51:22 SuperpowerBroadcasting: Biden won‚Äôt win in 2024.
* 51:25 SepSyn: Dems should be ALL OVER the strikes, supporting in anyway they can
* 51:27 Alloyed: whatever happened to that one bill that was being blocked by mark warner
* 51:30 hannahmander: local representation is also gonna be key, especially with midterms coming up
* 51:32 SuperpowerBroadcasting: The Dems need a strong candidate like Hillary Clinton
* 51:42 SepSyn: @superpowerbroadcasting strategizing
* 51:48 lazer_kiwi: Yeah unless Biden does something incredible then Biden is gonna get rocked in 24
* 51:55 imustbeNemo: Young candidate
* 51:58 hannahmander: it's not just about 2024, we still have 2022
* 52:03 timetravelinggroot: Biden broke Obama record for voter turnout, what are the charts showing us?
* 52:11 imustbeNemo: Not Kamala (she's not liked similar to Hillary)
* 52:13 commdorvis: I like Hillary Clinton but her doing better than Biden in 2024 is hilarious
* 52:16 timetravelinggroot: Obamas*
* 52:19 SepSyn: We need to highlight the new jobs that would be created
* 52:30 imustbeNemo: Michelle Obama would probably win
* 52:34 imustbeNemo: But she won't run
* 52:42 SuperpowerBroadcasting: @dylanburnstv It‚Äôs gonna be Donald Trump in 2024 for the GOP. The Dems need a strong candidate. Hillary Clinton has been vindicated on EVERYTHING the last 4 years. It should be Clinton vs Trump in 2024. She would destroy him.
* 52:59 SepSyn: @superpowerbroadcasting no shot
* 53:02 evo_lutia: @imustbeNemo Adding to his issues, we have to consider his life expectancy as well. The DNC will run Kamala Harris and lose in the next presidential cycle, almost certainly.
* 53:03 archipelajoe: I think bringing federal jobs in the like of the TVA and the CCC would do wonders
* 53:04 imustbeNemo: In the debate? Yes. In the election? No.
* 53:11 melashingo: @superpowerbroadcasting you have to be kidding..
* 53:13 SuperpowerBroadcasting: @sepsyn then the Dems lose in 2024
* 53:14 lazer_kiwi: Honestly I don't think the dems can win 2024 no matter the candidate. Trump returning to the presidency is all but inevitable at this stage, sorry to be a doomer
* 53:19 danabo: @SuperpowerBroadcasting This would be good for the Twitch Politics grift at least.
* 53:25 kim_jong_rodman: we face disaster in the senate

* 53:48 kim_jong_rodman: Im still with her @SuperpowerBroadcasting
* 53:48 SepSyn: she was the worst possible candidate
* 53:53 archipelajoe: Clinton name is not politically viable in this age
* 53:53 hannahmander: @lazer_kiwi i hate that you're right, lol. Hopefully we can keep congress away from him at least
* 53:59 zezou124: do you think its gonna be biden in 2024 running
* 54:00 Frog_TV: Hillary is the worst candidate to run
* 54:05 DJQuad: there's 0% chance trump will run again imo
* 54:07 SuperpowerBroadcasting: @dylanburnstv He won by like net 70k in 3 states total
* 54:12 HeroAndOldMan: Doomer thought. Trump is going to try and run again in 2028. He'll argue two terms have to be consecutive.
* 54:18 kainmalice: I hate Republicans and considered voting for Trump because i hate her
* 54:22 SuperpowerBroadcasting: @dylanburnstv She won the popular vote and Trump is at a high unpopularity
* 54:25 flashman7870: @SuperpowerBroadcasting its not 2016 bro
* 54:27 SepSyn: we need a strong labor candidate
* 54:33 kyiv_stuff: Not Hillary again
* 54:33 TheHounding: What we really need is Yang he can just bribe all these people for their votes just call it union basic income
* 54:38 imustbeNemo: @DylanBurnsTV he's talking about the EC
* 54:38 Alloyed: yep, looked up PRO act is still stalled in the senate
* 54:45 SepSyn: that'd be a chat id like to hear
* 54:49 flashman7870: DylanBurnsTv he's not talking about popular vote hes talking about net votes in the states that swung it
* 54:55 evo_lutia: I wish we could run Bernie and ban him from using the word socialist. He needs to call himself an FDR/Union Dem and be done with it.
* 54:58 imustbeNemo: 70k across 3 states in 2016 gave the orange loser the WH
* 55:01 kim_jong_rodman: Biden is our best shot un 2024

* 55:12 flashman7870: @DylanBurnsTV e's not talking about popular vote hes talking about net votes in the states that swung it
* 55:22 SuperpowerBroadcasting: @dylanburnstv I could be on in about half an hour. I‚Äôm not at home currently
* 55:29 kyiv_stuff: Biden is too old for the 2nd term
* 55:33 kim_jong_rodman: WE are doomed in the senate for teh foreseeable future
* 55:35 SepSyn: I'm down to hear y'all hash that out
* 55:40 evo_lutia: @kyiv_stuff He really is.
* 55:46 Ard_Ryan_86: The problem is, going pro union can rock the boat with the corporate class. It‚Äôs just so odd thinking about Republican rebranding on Union. It‚Äôs working apparently, probably because the Corporate class is at a distance with them.. weighing their options.. but at the same time, creating unions in the name of the Corporate interests is something Republicans are likely open to.
* 55:48 albz5424: I‚Äôm with Dylan on this one
* 55:48 imustbeNemo: Ro Khanna, but he doesn't have enough experience
* 55:49 belgiumpolitic: who,should you run
* 55:55 ImminentWon: we need to just elect AI into office already. it's the perfect solution
* 55:58 hannahmander: I mean a discussion on possible dem candidates is interesting tho
* 56:00 archipelajoe: Dems are in a bad spot with next options for president imo.
* 56:02 HeroAndOldMan: isn't Kamal 2024 pretty much a lock-in at this point?

* 02:54:40 Fluff1432: @DylanBurnsTV The District does not have a law targeted specifically to a home intruder. In terms of self-defense, D.C. has a law that states a person can defend themselves when they truly believe that they're in danger of bodily harm or death. However, the law also states the person is required to take reasonable measures by stepping back or walking away. Section 22-40503.01 of D.C.'s law allows someone to use a firearm if it's done in legitimate self-defense.
