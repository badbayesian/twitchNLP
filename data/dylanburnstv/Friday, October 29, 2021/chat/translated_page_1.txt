* 02:06:20 CJOracle: social pressure, that's nothing new
* 02:06:31 ImminentWon: if a person feels as if people face undue criticism due to the system or idealogies or whatever, they necessarily look for a way to rectify that injustice, that is cancel culture
* 02:06:35 documentthedebate: the hunter arc is the best thing that happened to politics

* 02:09:45 Origin_of_Language: Hunter, you’re no English major. And I highly doubt you even know how do why words adapt over the years.
* 02:09:46 godemperor4: Changing definitions is Marxism
* 02:09:54 weebcosmic: Because societies chnage economically and socially. 200 years ago no one would ever have thought we'd be connected to one another worldwide

* 02:10:08 NomadicDarling: Clarity, inclusion, aesthetics, I could think of a bunch of things
* 02:10:10 beastacle: hell, murder has several social definitions. "man, i murdered that cheese burger" just means you at it voraciously and left nothing behind.

* 02:13:46 Spudfm: based
* 02:13:47 kyiv_stuff: Some people like to use hyperbole and generalize. Then the opponents of the movement generalize the generalizations of those individuals, and here we are.
* 02:13:50 FatherFrijole: self report
* 02:13:51 CJOracle: but that example shows that the libertarian does not think it is a problem
* 02:13:53 Origin_of_Language: The terms these online people constantly spew are empty and vacuous.

* 02:13:56 st3w4rt: he isn't @WastedDesign deal with it
* 02:13:58 weebcosmic: It's super weird that people would equivocate these two groups as equally correct. One group wants to be treated as any normal human being, the other group doesn't.

* 02:14:08 commdorvis: Some laws are racist by intention, personal racism didn't disappear in the early 2000s or something. I don't like how this is the go-to defense of "systemic racism" by some people.
* 02:14:09 giomonaldo: @EnbieVenezuelan maybe we should, debate is better than ostracizing
* 02:14:11 NomadicDarling: Yeah I kinda agree with Connor on that. So many folks just talk and don't do any direct action or at least donate
* 02:14:11 Origin_of_Language: Sounds like you all want to make money.
* 02:14:16 documentthedebate: what?!?!?!
* 02:14:18 Iolhax: I see CRT as a heuristic lens to employ alongside others. Likewise, I see the appropriateness in people that make themselves avatars of CRT because it developed problems that would otherwise be ignored.
* 02:14:18 ImminentWon: @darkraven179 thank you, i thought it was a piece of a shower curtain hanger or something
