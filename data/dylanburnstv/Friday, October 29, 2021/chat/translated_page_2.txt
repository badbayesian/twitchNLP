* 02:37:01 angryliberal: @dylanburnstv I will say, it is kinda petty to change Hunters name from HunterAvolone to just Hunter after he requested it... like streamers names are how they grow. so I think him asking for the correct full spelling is warranted
* 02:37:02 kapinkronik1: you do you boo boo, im big on that
* 02:37:05 morrillo__: cis is math; cos theta + i sine theta ?

* 02:37:57 Fluff1432: @CriticallyThinkingVeteran it is infact an academic term. beliee it or not
* 02:37:57 CriticallyThinkingVeteran: It's language that was developed in the 90's, by a German sexoligist.... So no real basis.
* 02:37:57 WastedDesign: yee haw mpertner
* 02:37:57 newtond1221: I think most people do still say that?
* 02:37:59 hannahmander: gender dictates patriotism now
* 02:38:01 chiseldeepest: Cis just comes from existing language about cis and trans molecules lmao it‚Äôs not that deep
* 02:38:01 flickmo: ???
* 02:38:02 justcoolintbh: Patriotic lmaooo
* 02:38:03 NomadicDarling: And what is that political narrative?
* 02:38:04 whataboutblm: "I've yet to meet an open-minded conservative" isn't the slam dunk she thinks it is
* 02:38:04 lovewill1: Oh god. So you have have to be Republican to be Patriotic?
* 02:38:05 Smartsport101: cis is a really helpful word cause the old alternative was "real" as in "real man vs trans man" (pretty transphobic), now it's "cis man vs trans man".
* 02:38:05 tower_of_babel_8: yeah what is she even talking about
* 02:38:06 brodensporkley: I would guess Conservatives only use Cis half-mockingly
* 02:38:07 newtond1221: what in the actual fuck
* 02:38:08 eastm8: I'm incredibly patriotic; I'm cis; fytb
* 02:38:08 ImminentWon: so...because the people on the right are ignorant, the left is engaging in idpol by default? lmao wtf
* 02:38:08 cmagruder: "Pushes a specific political narrative." Lolfuckingl
* 02:38:09 lovewill1: GIRL BYE
* 02:38:10 oopzilla: she doesnt think lgbt on discriminated against
* 02:38:14 kpfettstyle: Cis is literally a biological term used to describe non-trans individuals lol
* 02:38:15 Aether0: think most people just say straight/gay/trans
* 02:38:17 beastacle: real patriots are progressive.
* 02:38:17 monkeyninja25: man we're getting cooky in the debate
* 02:38:20 lovewill1: BYE FELICIA
* 02:38:21 atterrant: more concepts about sexuality is more thought wtf
* 02:38:21 Proletato: They IDENTIFY as a duudee
* 02:38:25 brittbritt90d: Blaire White is a transphobe
* 02:38:25 TheFallenPrime: TRUE, FROM HER KEKW
* 02:38:28 commiecatt: more so clear its a specific example
* 02:38:29 NomadicDarling: Which is bad btw
* 02:38:31 partia1pressur3: I thought cis was in contrast to trans, not straight vs gay
* 02:38:34 giomonaldo: terfs exist
* 02:38:36 surripere: most ppl criticizing Blaire are anti-bigot
* 02:38:39 TheFallenPrime: YOU'RE GONNA SEE THE TRANSPHOBIC GARABGE FROM BLAIRE KEKW
* 02:38:41 NomadicDarling: Don't misgender Blaire White.
* 02:38:47 WastedDesign: theyre called dude ranches for a reason KKona
* 02:38:49 SapphiricNeon: Anyone else confused right now?
* 02:38:55 ironfalcon6: Ah yes the two genders, male and political
* 02:38:56 newtond1221: I hope this woman falls into irrelevance and never gets invited again
* 02:38:58 FluShot22: doesnt cis have to do with gender and not sexuality?
* 02:39:04 NomadicDarling: You can criticize Blaire White without being transphobic
* 02:39:04 PsychMania: Maybe because Blaire white‚Äôs identity has no bearing as to whether she provides good or bad argument gothix.
* 02:39:08 lazer_kiwi: MEMRI moment
* 02:39:11 WastedDesign: @brent778 no one cares
* 02:39:15 jemdreamz: ü´Ä
* 02:39:15 iceslick1: yes cis does with gender
* 02:39:19 GonzosWife: The word cis has nothing to do with any narrative
* 02:39:21 commdorvis: @ironfalcon6 Yeah dude I'm so tired of all the forced diversity today
* 02:39:23 giomonaldo: @brent778 lol I saw that
* 02:39:25 beastacle: @nomadicdarling indeed. attack blaire's shitty takes, not her gender.
* 02:39:27 evo_lutia: @brittbritt90d Remember when Blair White lied about a trans gender weightlifter who never competed in female events and only ever was a personal trainer? She nearly ruined a woman's life for her identity politics.
* 02:39:27 TheBlindKoala: no no talking from hunter KEKW
* 02:39:31 CrabsGoPinch: I aint no SIS MAN KKonaW
* 02:39:31 truetaughtyou: @newtond1221 jesus christ, why? can u not handle a difference in opinion? u prefer non stop echo chambers?
* 02:39:31 Fluff1432: why is he saying adacemic like a slur
* 02:39:32 catchabutterfly: Gothix Google Cis gender, you'll then understand the meaning
* 02:39:35 kyiv_stuff: Cis is short for cisgender- meaning your gender corresponds the one you were assigned at birth. It‚Äôs a necessary term.
* 02:39:35 cmagruder: College as opposed to "talk radio" spaces
* 02:39:36 Drake_2112: @SapphiricNeon I'm confused but I've been drinking so... yeah

* 02:40:49 tower_of_babel_8: cis and straight are completely different concepts tho
* 02:40:51 kapinkronik1: i care more about what im going to eat fo breakfast, shout out yogurt, then how someone identifies as far as gender goes. how someone wants to be identified as a gender literally does not effect me, like at all.

In other words, they don‚Äôt fit into the binary (go figure), so saying they‚Äôre non-binary is kind of obvious if they‚Äôre tying these pronouns back to gender.

If you‚Äôre wondering why I said it, it‚Äôs because Destiny responded to a video of Demonmama‚Äôs where I think she mentioned some kind of hypothetical where she‚Äôs a man. He said ‚Äúdemon-papa‚Äù and laughed. It‚Äôs from the self-diagnosing drama from a couple months ago.
