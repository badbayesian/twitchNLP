* 03:43:14 DylanBurnsTV: @Fluff1432 no
* 03:43:14 iamdamosuzuki_: This is a really interesting debate to watch since I don’t agree with either of them politically. Destiny is too liberal and Haz is a deranged Tankie

* 03:43:23 geneticallymodifiedpossum: The republican who also vote no are not nearly as important right now as the dems that refuse to vote for the presidents agenda
* 03:43:25 weebcosmic: Can we just do a 1 talking point at a time instead of going on for like 10 minute essays and expect each other to reply to all of it?
* 03:43:27 FrznKnght: A unified party is no better then a cult. Each politician should be voting for their own citizens. Not along party lines with no differences.
