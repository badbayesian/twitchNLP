* 02:37:50 bluemagepaladin: The creator of the crt strat said it was to "freeze their brand"
* 02:37:53 kim_jong_rodman: Dude i think theyre missing the larger picture. Well above CRT or any other issue is the fact bidens approval rating is 42%. Thats horrible. WE saw large (even larger than VA it looks like ) republican shifts in New Jersey. The antional environment is jsut horrible rn. Focusing too much on CRT doesnt tell the bigger story
* 02:37:54 TheBasedGreeg: No it isn’t, Republicans unironically think Democrats are trying to push CRT on every white child to make them feel guilty or some dumb shit

* 02:38:54 Iolhax: When he says "obfuscate" he's necessarily insinuating malice. it's middle-school levels of stupid.
* 02:38:54 seaufriclio: @guanteeene CRT is "critical race theory" which is taught typically in grad schools but conservatives have spent the past few year and a half or so jamming everything they hate under to make it into a rage umbrella to rile up their voting base
* 02:39:02 rolandstott: @evo_lutia it doesnt, the book banning relates to the texas law, its just incidentially related bc both have some issues w crt

* 02:42:51 rolandstott: @TheBasedGreeg literally you havent engaged w the literature or real arguments if thats your argument. your argument also makes the lower classes captive to the govt since home schooling is more a class thing. also home schooling as sky rocketed in the pandemic
* 02:42:57 seaufriclio: it's just like how businesses are required to provide reasonable accommodations, that doesn't mean the person being accommodated gets to CHOOSE what that accommodation looks like
